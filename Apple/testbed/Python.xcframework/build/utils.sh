# Utility methods for use in an Xcode project.
#
# An iOS XCframework cannot include any content other than the library binary
# and relevant metadata. However, Python requires a standard library at runtime.
# Therefore, it is necessary to add a build step to an Xcode app target that
# processes the standard library and puts the content into the final app.
#
# In general, these tools will be invoked after bundle resources have been
# copied into the app, but before framework embedding (and signing).
#
# The following is an example script, assuming that:
# * Python.xcframework is in the root of the project
# * There is an `app` folder that contains the app code
# * There is an `app_packages` folder that contains installed Python packages.
# -----
#   set -e
#   source $PROJECT_DIR/Python.xcframework/build/build_utils.sh
#   install_python Python.xcframework app app_packages
# -----

# Copy the standard library from the XCframework into the app bundle.
#
# Accepts one argument:
# 1. The path, relative to the root of the Xcode project, where the Python
#    XCframework can be found.
