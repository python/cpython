# Overview

NOTE: This file requires more content.

Since Python 3.7.2, releases have been made through the Microsoft Store
to allow easy installation on Windows 10.0.17763.0 and later.

# Building

To build the store package, the PC/layout script should be used.
Execute the directory with the build of Python to package, and pass
"-h" for full command-line options.

To sideload test builds, you will need a local certificate.
Instructions are available at
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/create-certificate-package-signing.

After exporting your certificate, you will need the subject name and
SHA256 hash. The `certutil -dump <cert file>` command will display this
information.

To build for sideloading, use these commands in PowerShell:

```
$env:APPX_DATA_PUBLISHER=<your certificate subject name>
$env:APPX_DATA_SHA256=<your certificate SHA256>
$env:SigningCertificateFile=<your certificate file>

python PC/layout --copy <layout directory> --include-appxmanifest
Tools/msi/make_appx.ps1 <layout directory> python.msix -sign

Add-AppxPackage python.msix
```

(Note that only the last command requires PowerShell, and the others
can be used from Command Prompt. You can also double-click to install
the final package.)

To build for publishing to the Store, use these commands:

```
$env:APPX_DATA_PUBLISHER = $null
$env:APPX_DATA_SHA256 = $null

python PC/layout --copy <layout directory> --preset-appxmanifest --precompile
Tools/msi/make_appx.ps1 <layout directory> python.msix
```

Note that this package cannot be installed locally. It may only be
added to a submission for the store.

## Title

Python 3.7

## Short Title

Python

## Description

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python Web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

## ShortDescription

The Python 3.7 interpreter and runtime.
