.SH NAME
tixwish \-  Windowing shell for interpreting Tix commands.
'\"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtixwish\fR ?\fIfileName arg arg ...\fR?
'\"
.SH OPTIONS
'\"
.IP "\fB\-display \fIdisplay\fR" 20
Display (and screen) on which to display window.
'\"
.IP "\fB\-geometry \fIgeometry\fR" 20
Initial geometry to use for window.  If this option is specified, its
value is stored in the \fBgeometry\fR global variable of the application's
Tcl interpreter.
'\"
.IP "\fB\-name \fIname\fR" 20
'\"
Use \fIname\fR as the title to be displayed in the window, and
as the name of the interpreter for \fBsend\fR commands.
'\"
.IP "\fB\-sync\fR" 20
'\"
Execute all X server commands synchronously, so that errors are
reported immediately. This will result in much slower execution, but
it is useful for debugging.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTixwish\fR is a simple program consisting of the Tcl command
language, the Tk toolkit, and a main program that reads commands from
standard input or from a file.  It creates a main window and then
processes Tcl commands.
'\"
If \fBtixwish\fR is invoked with no arguments, or with a first
argument that starts with ``\-'', then it reads Tcl commands
interactively from standard input.
'\"
It will continue processing commands until all windows have been
deleted or until end-of-file is reached on standard input.  If there
exists a file \fB.tixwishrc\fR in the home directory of the user,
\fBtixwish\fR evaluates the file as a Tcl script just before reading
the first command from standard input.
'\"
.PP
'\"
If \fBtixwish\fR is invoked with an initial \fIfileName\fR argument,
then \fIfileName\fR is treated as the name of a script file.
\fBTixwish\fR will evaluate the script in \fIfileName\fR (which
presumably creates a user interface), then it will respond to events
until all windows have been deleted.  Commands will not be read from
standard input.  There is no automatic evaluation of \fB.tixwishrc\fR
in this case, but the script file can always \fBsource\fR it if
desired.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBTixwish\fR automatically processes all of the command-line options
described in the \fBOPTIONS\fR summary above.  Any other command-line
arguments besides these are passed through to the application using
the \fBargc\fR and \fBargv\fR variables described later.

.SH "APPLICATION NAME AND CLASS"
.PP
.VS
The name of the application, which is used for purposes such as
\fBsend\fR commands, is taken from the \fB\-name\fR option,
if it is specified;  otherwise it is taken from \fIfileName\fR,
if it is specified, or from the command name by which
\fBtixwish\fR was invoked.  In the last two cases, if the name contains a ``/''
character, then only the characters after the last slash are used
as the application name.
.PP
The class of the application, which is used for purposes such as
specifying options with a \fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fR property or .Xdefaults
file, is the same as its name except that the first letter is
capitalized.
.VE

.SH "VARIABLES"
.PP
\fBTixwish\fR sets the following Tcl variables:
.TP 15
\fBargc\fR
Contains a count of the number of \fIarg\fR arguments (0 if none),
not including the options described above.
.TP 15
\fBargv\fR
Contains a Tcl list whose elements are the \fIarg\fR arguments (not
including the options described above), in order, or an empty string
if there are no \fIarg\fR arguments.
.TP 15
\fBargv0\fR
Contains \fIfileName\fR if it was specified.
Otherwise, contains the name by which \fBtixwish\fR was invoked.
.TP 15
\fBgeometry\fR
If the \fB\-geometry\fR option is specified, \fBtixwish\fR copies its
value into this variable.  If the variable still exists after
\fIfileName\fR has been evaluated, \fBtixwish\fR uses the value of
the variable in a \fBwm geometry\fR command to set the main
window's geometry.
.TP 15
\fBtcl_interactive\fR
'\"
Contains 1 if \fBtixwish\fR is reading commands interactively
(\fBfileName\fR was not specified and standard input is a
terminal-like device), 0 otherwise.
'\"
.SH "X RESOURCES"
'\"
\fBTixwish\fR makes use of several X Resources to determine the
\fBToolkit Options\fR for the Tix library. These X resources must be
set using \fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fR properties or .Xdefaults files
\fBbefore\fR \fBtixwish\fR starts running. These resources must be
associated with the main window of the \fBtixwish\fR application.
These options include:
'\"
'\"----------BEGIN
.LP
.nf
Name:		\fBtixScheme\fR
Class:		\fBTixScheme\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the color scheme to use for the Tix application. Currently
only these schemes are supported: Blue, Gray, SGIGray, TixGray, and
TK.
'\"----------END
'\"
'\"----------BEGIN
.LP
.nf
Name:		\fBtixFontSet\fR
Class:		\fBTixFontSet\fR
.fi
.IP
Specifies the FontSet to use for the Tix application. A FontSet
designates the fonts to use for different types of widgets. Currently
only these FontSets are supported: 12Point, 14Point and TK.
'\"----------END
.PP
For example, you may put these two lines in your .Xdefaults file
.nf
    *tixwish.tixScheme: Gray
    *tixwish.tixFontSet: 12Point
.fi
.SH "SCRIPT FILES"
.PP
If you create a Tcl script in a file whose first line is
.RS
.CS
\fB#!/usr/local/bin/tixwish\fR
.CE
.RE
then you can invoke the script file directly from your shell if you
mark it as executable.  This assumes that \fBtixwish\fR has been
installed in the default location in /usr/local/bin; if it's installed
somewhere else then you'll have to modify the above line to match.
Many UNIX systems do not allow the \fB#!\fR line to exceed about 30
characters in length, so be sure that the \fBtixwish\fR executable can be
accessed with a short file name.

.SH PROMPTS
.PP
When \fBtixwish\fR is invoked interactively it normally prompts for each
command with ``\fB% \fR''.  You can change the prompt by setting the
variables \fBtcl_prompt1\fR and \fBtcl_prompt2\fR.  If variable
\fBtcl_prompt1\fR exists then it must consist of a Tcl script to
output a prompt; instead of outputting a prompt \fBtixwish\fR will
evaluate the script in \fBtcl_prompt1\fR.  The variable
\fBtcl_prompt2\fR is used in a similar way when a newline is typed but
the current command isn't yet complete; if \fBtcl_prompt2\fR isn't set
then no prompt is output for incomplete commands.
