.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The first three routines convert the case of individual Unicode characters:
.PP
If \fIch\fR represents a lower-case character,
\fBTcl_UniCharToUpper\fR returns the corresponding upper-case
character.  If no upper-case character is defined, it returns the
character unchanged.
.PP
If \fIch\fR represents an upper-case character,
\fBTcl_UniCharToLower\fR returns the corresponding lower-case
character.  If no lower-case character is defined, it returns the
character unchanged.
.PP
If \fIch\fR represents a lower-case character,
\fBTcl_UniCharToTitle\fR returns the corresponding title-case
character.  If no title-case character is defined, it returns the
corresponding upper-case character.  If no upper-case character is
defined, it returns the character unchanged.  Title-case is defined
for a small number of characters that have a different appearance when
they are at the beginning of a capitalized word.
.PP
The next three routines convert the case of UTF-8 strings in place in
memory:
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR changes every UTF-8 character in \fIstr\fR to
upper-case.  Because changing the case of a character may change its
size, the byte offset of each character in the resulting string may
differ from its original location.  \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR writes a null
byte at the end of the converted string.  \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR returns
the new length of the string in bytes.  This new length is guaranteed
to be no longer than the original string length.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToLower\fR is the same as \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR except it
turns each character in the string into its lower-case equivalent.
.PP
\fBTcl_UtfToTitle\fR is the same as \fBTcl_UtfToUpper\fR except it
turns the first character in the string into its title-case equivalent
and all following characters into their lower-case equivalents.

.SH BUGS
.PP
At this time, the case conversions are only defined for the ISO8859-1
characters.  Unicode characters above 0x00ff are not modified by these
routines.
