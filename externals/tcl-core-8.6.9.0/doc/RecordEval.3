Tcl_RecordAndEval \- save command on history list before evaluating
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR(\fIinterp, cmd, flags\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Tcl interpreter in which to evaluate command.
.AP "const char" *cmd in
Command (or sequence of commands) to execute.
.AP int flags in
An OR'ed combination of flag bits.  \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR means record the
command but do not evaluate it.  \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR means evaluate
the command at global level instead of the current stack level.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using \fBTcl_Eval\fR
(or \fBTcl_GlobalEval\fR if the \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR bit is set in \fIflags\fR).
It returns a completion code such as \fBTCL_OK\fR just like \fBTcl_Eval\fR
and it leaves information in the interpreter's result.
If you do not want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke \fBTcl_Eval\fR instead of \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR.
Normally \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently-invoked commands.
If the \fIflags\fR argument contains the \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.
.PP
Note that \fBTcl_RecordAndEval\fR has been largely replaced by the
value-based procedure \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR.
That value-based procedure records and optionally executes
a command held in a Tcl value instead of a string.
