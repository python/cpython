.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBcoroutine\fR command creates a new coroutine context (with associated
command) named \fIname\fR and executes that context by calling \fIcommand\fR,
passing in the other remaining arguments without further interpretation. Once
\fIcommand\fR returns normally or with an exception (e.g., an error) the
coroutine context \fIname\fR is deleted.
.PP
Within the context, values may be generated as results by using the
\fByield\fR command; if no \fIvalue\fR is supplied, the empty string is used.
When that is called, the context will suspend execution and the
\fBcoroutine\fR command will return the argument to \fByield\fR. The execution
of the context can then be resumed by calling the context command, optionally
passing in the \fIsingle\fR value to use as the result of the \fByield\fR call
that caused
the context to be suspended. If the coroutine context never yields and instead
returns conventionally, the result of the \fBcoroutine\fR command will be the
result of the evaluation of the context.
.PP
.VS TIP396
The coroutine may also suspend its execution by use of the \fByieldto\fR
command, which instead of returning, cedes execution to some command called
\fIcommand\fR (resolved in the context of the coroutine) and to which \fIany
number\fR of arguments may be passed. Since every coroutine has a context
command, \fByieldto\fR can be used to transfer control directly from one
coroutine to another (this is only advisable if the two coroutines are
expecting this to happen) but \fIany\fR command may be the target. If a
coroutine is suspended by this mechanism, the coroutine processing can be
resumed by calling the context command optionally passing in an arbitrary
number of arguments. The return value of the \fByieldto\fR call will be the
list of arguments passed to the context command; it is up to the caller to
decide what to do with those values.
.PP
The recommended way of writing a version of \fByield\fR that allows resumption
with multiple arguments is by using \fByieldto\fR and the \fBreturn\fR
command, like this:
.PP
.CS
proc yieldm {value} {
    \fByieldto\fR return -level 0 $value
}
.CE
.VE TIP396
.PP
The coroutine can also be deleted by destroying the command \fIname\fR, and
the name of the current coroutine can be retrieved by using
\fBinfo coroutine\fR.
If there are deletion traces on variables in the coroutine's
implementation, they will fire at the point when the coroutine is explicitly
deleted (or, naturally, if the command returns conventionally).
.PP
At the point when \fIcommand\fR is called, the current namespace will be the
global namespace and there will be no stack frames above it (in the sense of
\fBupvar\fR and \fBuplevel\fR). However, which command to call will be
determined in the namespace that the \fBcoroutine\fR command was called from.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
This example shows a coroutine that will produce an infinite sequence of
even values, and a loop that consumes the first ten of them.
.PP
.CS
proc allNumbers {} {
    \fByield\fR
    set i 0
    while 1 {
        \fByield\fR $i
        incr i 2
    }
}
\fBcoroutine\fR nextNumber allNumbers
for {set i 0} {$i < 10} {incr i} {
    puts "received [\fInextNumber\fR]"
}
rename nextNumber {}
.CE
.PP
In this example, the coroutine acts to add up the arguments passed to it.
.PP
.CS
\fBcoroutine\fR accumulator apply {{} {
    set x 0
    while 1 {
        incr x [\fByield\fR $x]
    }
}}
for {set i 0} {$i < 10} {incr i} {
    puts "$i -> [\fIaccumulator\fR $i]"
}
.CE
.PP
This example demonstrates the use of coroutines to implement the classic Sieve
of Eratosthenes algorithm for finding prime numbers. Note the creation of
coroutines inside a coroutine.
.PP
.CS
proc filterByFactor {source n} {
    \fByield\fR [info coroutine]
    while 1 {
        set x [\fI$source\fR]
        if {$x % $n} {
            \fByield\fR $x
        }
    }
}
\fBcoroutine\fR allNumbers apply {{} {while 1 {\fByield\fR [incr x]}}}
\fBcoroutine\fR eratosthenes apply {c {
    \fByield\fR
    while 1 {
        set n [\fI$c\fR]
        \fByield\fR $n
        set c [\fBcoroutine\fR prime$n filterByFactor $c $n]
    }
}} allNumbers
for {set i 1} {$i <= 20} {incr i} {
    puts "prime#$i = [\fIeratosthenes\fR]"
}
.CE
.PP
.VS TIP396
This example shows how a value can be passed around a group of three
coroutines that yield to each other:
.PP
.CS
proc juggler {name target {value ""}} {
    if {$value eq ""} {
        set value [\fByield\fR [info coroutine]]
    }
    while {$value ne ""} {
        puts "$name : $value"
        set value [string range $value 0 end-1]
        lassign [\fByieldto\fR $target $value] value
    }
}
\fBcoroutine\fR j1 juggler Larry [
    \fBcoroutine\fR j2 juggler Curly [
        \fBcoroutine\fR j3 juggler Moe j1]] "Nyuck!Nyuck!Nyuck!"
.CE
.VE TIP396
.SS "DETAILED SEMANTICS"
.PP
This example demonstrates that coroutines start from the global namespace, and
that \fIcommand\fR resolution happens before the coroutine stack is created.
.PP
.CS
proc report {where level} {
    # Where was the caller called from?
    set ns [uplevel 2 {namespace current}]
    \fByield\fR "made $where $level context=$ns name=[info coroutine]"
}
proc example {} {
    report outer [info level]
}
namespace eval demo {
    proc example {} {
        report inner [info level]
    }
    proc makeExample {} {
        puts "making from [info level]"
        puts [\fBcoroutine\fR coroEg example]
    }
    makeExample
}
.CE
.PP
Which produces the output below. In particular, we can see that stack
manipulation has occurred (comparing the levels from the first and second
line) and that the parent level in the coroutine is the global namespace. We
can also see that coroutine names are local to the current namespace if not
qualified, and that coroutines may yield at depth (e.g., in called
procedures).
