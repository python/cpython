2004-12-29  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tcl.m4, win/configure: update MSVC CFLAGS_OPT to -O2, remove -Gs
	(included in -O2) and -GD (outdated). Use "link -lib" instead of "lib"
	binary and remove -YX for MSVC7 portability. Add -fomit-frame-pointer
	for gcc OPT compiles. [Bug 1092952, 1091967] Align LIBS_GUI with Tk
	head needs.

2004-12-29  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclDate.c: Regen
	* generic/tclGetDate.y (TclDatelex): Fixed a problem where a
	four-digit group with >=2 leading zeroes appeared to be a two-digit
	group, leading to misinterpreting the time 0012 as 1200. [Bug 1090413]
	* library/clock.tcl: Added code to interpret correctly months outside
	the range 01-12 as reduced modulo 12 with a corresponding adjustment
	to the year. [Bug 1092789]
	* tests/clock.test: Added regression test cases for the above two bugs
	* unix/Makefile.in: Added --no-lines to the 'bison' command line to
	* win/Makefile.in: help constrain the number of diffs in a cvs checkin

2004-12-24  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclLiteral.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	Avoid sharing cmdName literals accross namespaces, and generalise
	usage of the TclRegisterNewLiteral macro. [Patch 1090905]

2004-12-20  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: moved TclInitCompiledLocals to tclProc.c
	* generic/tclProc.c: new static InitCompiledLocals to allow for a
	single pass over the proc's arguments at proc load time (instead of
	two as previously). TclObjInterpProc() now allocates the
	compiledLocals on the tcl execution stack, using the new
	TclStackAlloc/Free functions.

2004-12-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_LimitSetTime, TimeLimitCallback):
	(TclLimitRemoveAllHandlers, TclInitLimitSupport): Set a timer event to
	trigger when the time limit runs out. All the time limit actually does
	is check to see if the time limit has been exceeded, but this is
	enough to fix [Bug 1085023].
	* generic/tclInt.h (struct Interp): Added a field to hold the token
	for the timer event handler associated with the current time limit.
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_UpdateObjCmd, Tcl_VwaitObjCmd): Add error
	message when limit exceeded.
	* tests/interp.test (interp-34.[89]): Check that time limits handle
	the two cases reported in [Bug 1085023]

	* generic/tclTimer.c (TclCreateAbsoluteTimerHandler): New internal
	function that allows setting a timer handler that will be triggered at
	(or after) a specific time instead of at some number of milliseconds
	in the future. This is a candidate for future exposure via a TIP.

2004-12-15  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c: Added two new functions to allocate memory from
	the execution stack (TclStackAlloc, TclStackFree). Added functions
	TclPushStackFrame and TclPopStackFrame that do the work of
	Tcl_PushCallFrame and Tcl_PopCallFrame, but using frames allocated in
	the execution stack - i.e., heap instead of C-stack. The core uses
	these two new functions exclusively; the old ones remain for backwards
	compat, as at least two popular extensions (itcl, xotcl) are known to
	use them.

2004-12-14  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: changing the isProcCallFrame field of the
	CallFrame struct from a 0/1 field to flags. Should be perfectly
	backwards compatible.

2004-12-14  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in: Added special processing to remove "$U" from
	libraries in the LIBOBJS value. This is an auto-make-ism we need to
	avoid. [Bug 1081541]

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.57

2004-12-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Restored extern "C" guards so that C++ code sees
	function pointer typedef linkage consistent with earlier Tcl releases.
	[Bug 1082349]

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Plugged some memory leaks. Thanks to Rolf Ade
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	 for reports and testing [Bug 1083082]

2004-12-13  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n: Clarify that the [clock scan] command does not accept
	the full range of ISO8601 point-in-time formats. [Bug 1075433]

2004-12-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclArrayObjCmd - ARRAY_NAMES): leaking an object
	[Bug 1084111] - thanks to Rolf Ade.

2004-12-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclSetCmdNameObj): special handling for fully
	qualified command names (as in fix [Patch 456668]).

2004-12-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c: converting the static function
	GetNamespaceFromObj() to MODULE_SCOPE TclGetNamespaceFromObj().

2004-12-10  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tools/tcl.wse.in, unix/tcl.spec, win/README.binary, README:
	* win/configure.in, unix/configure.in, generic/tcl.h:
	Bumped version number to 8.5a3 to distinguish HEAD of CVS development
	from the recent 8.5a2 release.

2004-12-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclInitCompiledLocals):
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclObjInterpProc, TclCreateProc): optimised
	loops that initialise a proc's arguments and compiled local
	variables, removing tests from inner loops.

2004-12-10  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Move ensemble API decls here from tclNamesp.c

2004-12-09  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclMakeEnsembleCmd, TclSetEnsemble*)
	(TclSetEnsemble*, TclFindEnsemble): Build an internal API for creating
	and manipulating ensembles; they can be deleted using the normal
	command-deletion API.

	* doc/Async.3: Reword for better grammar, better nroff and get the
	flag name right. (Reported by David Welton.)

2004-12-07  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (2.1-4): Added constraints so that when a value
	of TCL_LIBRARY is required for process initialization, we skip the
	tests that mess with that value.

2004-12-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	*** 8.5a2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* unix/Makefile.in: add library/{tzdata,msgs} to dist target (kbk)

	* doc/foreach.n: Adjust tabs to be friendlier to some HTML
	converters. [Bug 1078760]

2004-12-06  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (NotifierThreadProc): init numFdBits
	[Bug 1079286]

	* doc/error.n, doc/SaveResult.3, doc/Thread.3: minor nroff typos

2004-12-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/safe.test:	Trim auto_path to improve performance [1080039]

	* tests/msgcat.test:	makeFile/removeFile cleanup [1079117]

2004-12-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:	Different fix for [Bug 1077005].
	* generic/tclEvent.c:	Broke apart TclpSetInitialEncodings() on
	* generic/tclInt.h:	Windows into TclpSetInterfaces(), that is
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:	fundamentally essential, and the initialization
	* win/tclWinInit.c:	of the system encoding, which is not. Made
	the TclpSetInterfaces call part of TclInitSubsystems so it cannot be
	overlooked.

2004-12-03  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* changes: updated for 8.5a2 release

2004-12-02  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclSetProcessGlobalValue): Handle the case where
	a ProcessGlobalValue might be assigned to itself.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (MakeFileMap): Correct refcounting errors
	managing values returned by TclPathPart (with refCount of 1!) that led
	to a memory leak. [Bug 1077474].

2004-12-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c:  fix and new tests for [Bug 1074671] to ensure
	* tests/fileSystem.test: tilde paths are not returned specially by
	'glob'.

2004-12-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/Makefile.in: Added a 'sed' in the setting of ROOT_DIR_NATIVE to
	compensate for a bug in cygpath (at least version 1.36) that leaves a
	trailing backslash on the end of the converted path.

2004-12-02  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Alias,Target,Master): Rewrote these so that the
	aliases that refer to an interpreter are stored in a list and not a
	hashtable (which was only ever a convenience, and forced the use of a
	global mutex to generate keys!) [FRQ 1077210]
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (numNsCreated): Moved into thread-local storage
	to remove a global mutex. [FRQ 1077210]

2004-12-01  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetProcessGlobalValue): Narrowed the scope of
	mutex locks.

	* generic/tclUtil.c:		Updated Tcl_GetNameOfExecutable() to
	* generic/tclEncoding.c:	make use of a ProcessGlobalValue for
	* generic/tclEvent.c:		storing the executable name. Added
	internal routines Tcl(Get|Set)ObjNameOfExecutable() to access that
	storage in Tcl_Obj, rather than string format.

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:	Rewrote TclpFindExecutable() to use
	* win/tclWinFile.c:	TclSetObjNameOfExecutable to store the
	executable name it computes.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Added internal stub entries for
	* generic/tclInt.decls: TclpFindExecutable and
	Tcl(Get|Set)ObjNameOfExecutable.

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: make genstubs
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:	Retrieve executable name in Tcl_Obj form
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:	instead of string form.

	* unix/tclUnixTest.c:	Update [testfindexecutable] command to use new
	internal interfaces.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:	Moved TclpSetInitialEncodings() call
	from Tcl_FindExecutable() into TclInitEncodingSubsystem(). This is
	important on Windows where it establishes whether the "ascii" or
	"unicode" set of system routines will be used, and that needs to be
	done earlier to support filesystem operations. [Bug 1077005]

2004-12-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/winDde.test: Rewritten to use tcltest2 features more
	thoroughly (reducing the [catch] count!) and fix the problem with
	winDde-6.1 being out of synch with the implementation.

2004-11-30  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl ([unknown]): Restored the save/restore of the
	variables ::errorCode and ::errorInfo. This is needed when the
	[::bgerror] command is auto-loaded (as it is by Tk).

	Patch 976520 reworks several of the details involved with
	startup/initialization of the Tcl library, focused on the activities
	of Tcl_FindExecutable().

	* generic/tclIO.c:	Removed bogus claim in comment that encoding
	"iso8859-1" is "built-in" to Tcl.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Created a new struct ProcessGlobalValue,
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	routines Tcl(Get|Set)ProcessGlobalValue, and
	function type TclInitProcessGlobalValueProc. Together, these take care
	of the housekeeping for "values" (things that can be held in a
	Tcl_Obj) that are global across a whole process. That is, they are
	shared among multiple threads, and epoch and mutex protection must
	govern the validity of cached copies maintained in each thread.

	* generic/tclNotify.c:	Modified TclInitNotifier() to tolerate being
	called multiple times in the same thread.
	* generic/tclEvent.c:	Dropped the unused argv0 argument to
	TclInitSubsystems(). Removed machinery to unsure only one
	TclInitNotifier() call per thread, now that that is safe. Converted
	Tcl(Get|Set)LibraryPath to use a ProcessGlobalValue, and moved them to
	tclEncoding.c.
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Updated caller.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	TclpFindExecutable now returns void.
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Built new encoding search initialization on a
	foundation of ProcessGlobalValues, exposing new routines
	Tcl(Get|Set)EncodingSearchPath. A cache of a map from encoding name to
	directory pathname keeps track of where encodings are available for
	loading. Tcl_FindExecutable greatly simplified into just three
	function calls. The "library path" is now misnamed, as its only
	remaining purpose is as a foundation for the default encoding search
	path.

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Inlined the initScript that is evaluated by
	Tcl_Init(). Added verification after initScript evaluation that Tcl
	can find its installed *.enc files, and that it has initialized
	[encoding system] in agreement with what the environment expects.
	[tclInit] no longer driven by the value of $::tcl_libPath; it largely
	constructs its own search path now, rather than attempt to share one
	with the encoding system.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:	TclpSetInitialEncodings factored so that a new
	* win/tclWinInit.c:	routine TclpGetEncodingNameFromEnvironment can
	reveal that Tcl thinks the [encoding system] should be, even when an
	incomplete encoding search path, or a missing *.enc file won't allow
	that initialization to succeed. TclpInitLibraryPath reworked as an
	initializer of a ProcessGlobalValue.

	* unix/tclUnixTest.c:	Update implementations of [testfindexecutable],
	[testgetdefenc], and [testsetdefenc].

	* tests/unixInit.test:	Corrected tests to operate properly even when
	a value of TCL_LIBRARY is required to find encodings.

	* generic/tclInt.decls: New internal stubs: TclGetEncodingSearchPath,
	TclSetEncodingSearchPath, TclpGetEncodingNameFromEnvironment. These
	are candidates for public exposure by future TIPs.

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: make genstubs
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

	* generic/tclTest.c:	Updated [testencoding] to use
	* tests/encoding.test:	Tcl(Get|Set)EncodingSearchPath.	 Updated tests.

2004-11-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl: Corrected the regular expressions that match a
	time zone to allow for time zones specified as +HH or -HH.
	* tests/clock.test: Added regression test case for the above issue.
	Thanks to Rolf Ade for reporting this issue [http://wiki.tcl.tk/13094]
	* win/tclWinDde.c (Tcl_DdeObjCmd): Corrected a typo that caused a
	compilation failure on VC++.

2004-11-29  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Brought entry '2004-10-26 Don
	Porter (Tcl Modules)' into the windows world, actually the
	win/configure buildsystem. The other windows buildsystems (.vc, .bc)
	still have to be updated as well.

2004-11-26  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinDde.c (ExecuteRemoteObject): Removed bogus semicolon found
	at the end of the header for the function definition, terminating it
	early and preventing a compile. This is likely a fix for '2004-11-25
	Donal'. I have to conclude that it is also unknown if the other
	changes to this file actually pass the testsuite. Running testsuite
	... They don't. winDde-6.1 fails. This is only a message discrepance,
	i.e. not too bad. Leaving resolution of that to Pat and Donal.

2004-11-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl (tcl_findLibrary): Made sure the uniquifying
	operations on the search path does not also normalize. [Bug 1072136]

2004-11-26  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/configure.in: Simplify the code to check for correctness of
	strstr, strtoul and strtod.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_TCL_CHECK_BROKEN_FUNC): Split a complex stanza out
	of configure.in into its own function. Also force it to do the right
	thing with cacheing of results of AC_TRY_RUN to deal with issue raised
	in [Patch 1073524]

	* doc/foreach.n: Added simple example. [FRQ 1073334]

2004-11-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclObjInterpProc):	    Make it so that only
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_WrongNumArgs): [proc] instances do
	* tests/indexObj.test (indexObj-5.7):	    quoting of their first
	arguments, so keeping [Bug 942757] fixed and making [Bug 1066837] be
	fixed as well. Done with a load of #ifdef-ery because this hack is so
	ugly nobody should keep it around once Itcl's fixed.

2004-11-25  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* tests/tcltest.test: The order in which [glob] returns the file names
	is undefined, so tests should not depend on it.

2004-11-25  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* doc/Thread.3:
	* doc/Notifier.3: Added changes from the core-8-4-branch

2004-11-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/dde.n: Synchronized the documentation of the commands with the
	header of the docs and what the package actually does. Thanks to
	Andreas Kupries for spotting this.
	* win/tclWinDde.c (Tcl_DdeObjCmd): Much cleanup of argument parsing
	code.

2004-11-24  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclPort.h: Relative include of tclWinPort.h returned as it
	was requiring me set -I$(tcl_root)/win for my extensions that need to
	include tclInt.h and doesn't appear to serve any purpose for windows
	builds.

2004-11-24  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Corrected bad check for 3-argument
	readdir_r [Bug 1001325].
	* unix/configure: Regenerated.
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: Corrected all uses of 'select' to manage their
	masks using the FD_CLR, FD_ISSET, FD_SET, and FD_ZERO macros rather
	than bit-whacking that failed under Solaris-Sparc-64. [Bug 1071807]
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath): Removed unused vars 'pathc'
	and 'pathv' that caused compilation problems on VC++ with
	--enable-symbols.

2004-11-24  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Corrected failure to determine the
	number of arguments for readdir_r on SunOS systems. [Bug 1071701]

	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.57

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoVarsCmd):	Corrected segfault in new
	* tests/info.test (info-19.6):	trivial matching branch [Bug 1072654]

2004-11-24  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tools/man2html.tcl, tools/man2html1.tcl: Update to use Tcl 8.4.
	* tools/man2html2.tcl: Fix broken .SS handling.

2004-11-23  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add (commented-out) code to integrate tclConfig.h
	into the dependency tree and 'make distclean'. [Bug 1068171]

	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_AppendResultVA): Remove call to
	Tcl_GetStringResult to speed up repeated calls to Tcl_AppendResult
	with the side effect that code that wants to access interp->result
	should always call Tcl_GetStringResult first. See [Patch 1041072]
	discussion for more details.

2004-11-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_TCL_64BIT_FLAGS): Define HAVE_TYPE_OFF64_T only when
	off64_t, open64(), and lseek64() are defined. IRIX 5.3 is known to not
	include an open64 function. [Bug 1030465]

2004-11-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Check for a 2 argument version of
	readdir_r that is known to exists under IRIX 5.3.
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir): Use either 2 arg or 3 arg version
	of readdir_r. [Bug 1001325]

2004-11-22  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath): Purged dead code that used
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  to extend the "library
	path". Search path construction for init.tcl is now done within the
	[tclInit] proc.
	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Restored several directories to the search
	* tests/unixInit.test:	path used to locate init.tcl within [tclInit].
	This change does not restore any directories to the encoding search
	path, so should still avoid the price of an unreasonably large number
	of filesystem accesses during encoding initialization at startup
	[Bug 976438]

2004-11-22  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix and new test for [Bug 1043129] in the
	* tests/fileSystem.test: treatment of backslashes in file join on
	Windows.

2004-11-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:	Typo corrections (Thanks Daniel South).
	* doc/interp.n:

2004-11-19  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:	Docs for Tcl_(Get|Set)ReturnOptions. [TIP 227]

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:
	* doc/Async.3:		Documentation updates to replace references
	* doc/BackgdErr.3:	to global variable ::errorInfo and ::errorCode
	* doc/SaveResult.3:	and to the ::bgerror command with references
	* doc/after.n:		to their preferred replacements, the
	* doc/bgerror.n:	-errorinfo and -errorcode return options,
	* doc/error.n:		the Tcl_*InterpState routines, and the
	* doc/exec.n:		[interp bgerror] command.
	* doc/exit.n:
	* doc/fileevent.n:
	* doc/interp.n:
	* doc/return.n:
	* doc/tclvars.n:
	* doc/update.n:

	* tests/unixInit.test: Removed "knownBug" constraints to prompt bug
	fixing before 8.5a2 release.

2004-11-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (MacOSXGetLibraryPath): changed detection of tcl
	framework build when determining tclLibPath from overloaded
	TCL_LIBRARY to configuration define TCL_FRAMEWORK. [Bug 1068088]

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.57
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in: autoheader-2.57

2004-11-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/SaveResult.3:	Documentation for Tcl_*InterpState (TIP 226).

	* generic/tclEvent.c (HandleBgErrors):	Simplified program flow.

	* tests/basic.test:	Updated functional (not testing) uses of
	* tests/io.test:	[bgerror] to make use of [interp bgerror].
	* tests/socket.test:
	* tests/timer.test:

	* tests/interp.test (interp-36.*):	[interp bgerror] tests.

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Corrected [interp bgerror] error messages.

2004-11-18  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_MANPAGES): Applied an improved version of
	* unix/configure.in:		    [Patch 996085], that introduces
	* unix/Makefile.in:		    --enable-man-suffix.

	* unix/installManPage:		    added
	* unix/mkLinks.tcl:		    removed
	* unix/mkLinks:			    removed
	* unix/configure:		    generated

	* unix/Makefile.in:		    Don't install tclConfig.h .

2004-11-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in: The change below reveals that the public data
	type Tcl_StatBuf relies on config information. For now, disabled the
	use of the tclConfig.h file until its full impact on Tcl's interface
	can be assessed.

	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.57

	* generic/tcl.h:	Moved the #include "tclConfig.h" out of
	* generic/tclInt.h:	tcl.h.	The config settings are not part of
	* generic/tclPort.:	the public interface, and having it there
	breaks compiled against uninstalled Tcl and extensions using
	autoconf-2.5*.

2004-11-16  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtySetOptionProc): fixed crash configuring
	-ttycontrol on a channel. [Bug 1067708]

2004-11-16  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclFSEpochOk): There were two code paths via
	which the thread copy of filesystemEpoch could be synched with the
	master copy, but only one kept the filesystem list cache up to date.
	Fix routes everything through a single code path. [Bug 1035775].

2004-11-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Stop architecture flags to 'ld' from
	getting lost when [load] is disabled. [Bug 1016796]

2004-11-16  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* unix/configure.in: changed HAVE_CONFIG_H to HAVE_TCL_CONFIG_H.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.57

2004-11-15  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Added comment warning that the old ERR_IN_PROGRESS
	and ERROR_CODE_SET flag values should not be re-used for the sake of
	those extensions that have accessed them.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TraceObjCmd): Fixed Bug 1065378 which failed
	* tests/trace.test (trace-33.1):	to permit a variable trace
	created with [trace variable] to be destroyed with [trace remove].
	Thanks to Keith Vetter for the report.

2004-11-15  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/tclvars.n: Added section to documentation on global variables
	that are specific to tclsh and wish. [Patch 1065732]

2004-11-12  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TableFromUtfProc): correct crash condition
	when TCL_UTF_MAX == 6. [Bug 1004065]

2004-11-12  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/interp.n: Basic documentation of the TIP#221 API.

2004-11-12  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	TIP #221 IMPLEMENTATION
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Define [::tcl::Bgerror] in new interps.
	* generic/tclEvent.c:	Update Tcl_BackgroundError to make use of the
				registered [interp bgerror] command.
	* generic/tclInterp.c:	New [interp bgerror] subcommand.
	* tests/interp.test:	syntax tests updated.

	TIP #226 IMPLEMENTATION
	* generic/tcl.decls:	Stubs for Tcl_(Save|Restore|Discard)InterpState
	* generic/tcl.h:	New public opaque type, Tcl_InterpState.
	* generic/tclInt.h:	Drop old private declarations. Add
				Tcl(Get|Set)BgErrorHandler
	* generic/tclResult.c:	Tcl_*InterpState implementations.
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	Update callers.
	* generic/tclIOGT.c:
	* generic/tclTrace.c:

	TIP #227 IMPLEMENTATION
	* generic/tcl.decls:	Stubs for Tcl_(Get|Set)ReturnOptions.
	* generic/tclInt.h:	Drop old private declarations.
	* generic/tclResult.c:	Tcl_*ReturnOptions implementations.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	Update callers.
	* generic/tclMain.c:

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	make genstubs
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

	* unix/tclAppInit.c:	Removed tclConfig.h #include, now that tcl.h
				takes care of it for us.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Moved verification of ptrdiff_t typedef from
	* generic/tclExecute.c: multiple .c files into one common header where
	* generic/tclVar.c:	it is verifiably after tclConfig.h inclusion.

2004-11-12  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/Makefile.in: include tclConfig.h from tcl.h and install it as a
	public header. Normalized compiler include path order to
	-I${BUILD_DIR} -I${UNIX_DIR} -I${GENERIC_DIR}.

	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: add ${BUILD_DIR}/.. to include path to pick
	up tclConfig.h.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: moved check for HAVE_CFBUNDLE define after
	#include "tclInt.h" to ensure tclConfig.h has been included.

2004-11-12  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/config.h.in:
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in:	renamed

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Completed support for config header,
	* unix/configure.in:	fixed building outside of the unix dir,
	* unix/tclAppinit.c:	and reflected the name change of config.h.
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* unix/configure:	generated

2004-11-12  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/config.h.in:	Allow configure to put all the C #defs into
	* unix/configure.in:	a file (called config.h) so that Unix builds
	* unix/tcl.m4:		now take far fewer lines of scrollback to
	* unix/Makefile.in:	proceed (making it less likely that any errors
	* generic/tclInt.h:	or warnings will get missed).
	* unix/tclAppInit.c:	Part of the TIP#34 upgrades.

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/tclUnixPort.h: Check for pthread_attr_get_np in
	<pthread.h> before forcing the use of <pthread_np.h> to make things
	work on NetBSD 2.0. [Bug 1064882]

	* doc/binary.n, doc/upvar.n: More minor fixes.

2004-11-12  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/CrtChannel.3:
	* doc/Interp.3:
	* doc/Limit.3:
	* doc/binary.n:
	* doc/dict.n:
	* doc/tm.n:
	* doc/upvar.n: fixed *roff errors uncovered by running 'make html'.

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: added faked support for bullet point
	lists, i.e. *nroff ".IP \(bu" syntax.

2004-11-11  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TraverseUnixTree): added option to rewind() the
	readdir() loop whenever the source hierarchy has been modified by
	traverseProc (e.g. by deleting files); this is required to ensure
	complete traversal of the source hierarchy on certain filesystems like
	HFS+. Added test for failing recursive delete on Mac OS X that was due
	to this. [Bug 1034337]

	* generic/tclListObj.c (Tcl_ListObjReplace): use memmove() instead of
	manual copy loop to shift list elements. Decreases time spent in
	Tcl_ListObjReplace() from 5.2% to 1.7% of overall runtime of tclbench
	on a ppc 7455 (i.e. 200% speed increase). [Patch 1064243]

	* generic/tclHash.c: hoisted some constant pointer dereferences out of
	loops to eliminate redundant loads that the gcc optimizer didn't deal
	with. Decreases time spend in Tcl_FindHashEntry() by 10% over a full
	run of the tcl testuite on a ppc 7455. [Patch 1064243]

	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/msgcat.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* tests/unixInit.test: fixed bugs causing failures when running tests
	with -tmpdir arg not set to working dir.

	* macosx/Makefile: corrected path to html help inside framework.
	Prevent parallel make from building several targets at the same time.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXFCmd.c (struct fileinfobuf): force struct to be
	packed to prevent failures when builing with -malign=natural.

2004-11-10  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: [Bug 727786]. Exterminated the code marked
	DEPRECATED. This code has not been used in over a year now, and we
	have no complaints.

2004-11-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: The pipe channel driver now respects the -blocking
	option when closing is the same way the UNIX side works. This is to
	avoid a hung shell when exiting due to open pipes that refuse to close
	in a graceful manner.
	* doc/open.n: Added a note about -blocking 0 and lack of exit status
	as it had never been documented. [Bug 947693]

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

	Scripts that use async pipes on windows, must (like the UNIX side) set
	-blocking to 1 before calling [close] to receive the exit status.

2004-11-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tests/winFile.test: added contraint to winFile-4.0 to prevent it
	being run on NT4 [Bug 981829]

2004-11-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/reg.test: Major reorganization so that this file is much
	easier for a normal Tcl maintainer to comprehend. The test flags are
	still very cryptic, but they appear to have to be that way. The number
	of skipped tests has increased, but now the skipped tests have much
	more meaningful content.

	* tests/tm.test (genpaths): Add a [file normalize] so we pick up
	Windows drive letters, etc. [Bug 1053568]

2004-11-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:	Updates toward an 8.5a2 release.

2004-11-03  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (FreeScan): Fixed a bug where scanning "Monday"
	with a base time other than midnight incorrectly carried the base time
	forward.

	* test/clock.test (clock-33.{5,5a}): Made the test failure more
	informative.

	* tests/clock.test (clock-34.{28,44,45,46}): Removed 'knownBug'
	constraints from tests that no longer fail.

	Thanks to Don Porter for reporting these.

2004-11-03  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tcl.h:		Moved the preprocessor logic
	* generic/tclDecls.h:		from tclInt.h of setting the
	* generic/tclInt.h:		TCL_STORAGE_CLASS macro to the
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:	tcl*Decls.h files now that no
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:	use of EXTERN is left in tclInt.h.
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:	Proto for Tcl_Main moved in tcl.h
	* win/tclWinPort.h:		to prior the inclusion of the Stubs
	headers as they are now resetting TCL_STORAGE_CLASS. Removed
	extraineous reset from tclWinPort.h. [Patch 1055668]

	* generic/tclCompile.h: Removed extrainious reset of TCL_STORAGE_CLASS
	missed in my last edit.

2004-11-03  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl ([unknown]): Corrections to the 2004-10-25 mods to
	Aunt ??? in [unknown]. Flaws revealed by Itcl test suite, which still
	apparently relies on this brokenness. Also added comment suggesting
	the error message that any code using this hack *ought* to receive in
	reply.

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TclCallVarTraces):  Improved ability to debug
	* tests/incr-old.test (incr-old-2.6):	  errors during variable
	* tests/incr.test (incr-{1,2}.28):	  traces by preserving the
	* tests/set.test (set-{2,4}.4):		  -errorinfo data.
	* tests/trace.test (trace-33.1):	  [Bug 527164]

2004-11-02  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: added a check for #ifdef __cplusplus around the
	#define of MODULE_SCOPE. About the only time it would be problem is
	when someone is statically linking to Tcl and accessing internals from
	a C++ file and has name mangling issues from the lack of "C" after
	'extern' [Patch 1055668].
	* generic/tclCompile.h: Exchanged use of the EXTERN macro to the new
	MODULE_SCOPE macro. Lowered exported internals count by 35. [Patch
	1055668]
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: exported internals dropped by a count of 14.
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h: Added use of MODULE_SCOPE on protos.
	* generic/tclRegexp.h: manipulating TCL_STORAGE_CLASS unnecessary.

2004-11-02  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:		Corrected some misleading
	* tests/tcltest.test (tcltest-26.1,2):	displays of ::errorInfo and
	::errorCode information when the -setup, -body, and/or -cleanup scripts
	return an unexpected return code. Thanks to Robert Seeger for the fix.
	[RFE 1017151].

2004-11-02  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Improved version of the
	NaN fix from Miguel Sofer. [Bug 761471]

2004-11-02  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/tzdata/America/Cuiaba: Change to DST rules for
	* library/tzdata/America/Havana: autumn of 2004.
	[ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2004g.tar.gz]

	* tools/tclZIC.tcl: Updated to be compatible with recent changes in
	library/clock.tcl.

2004-11-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: Simplify TclpUtime to use Tcl_FSGetNativePath, and
	add comments.

2004-11-02  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Change uses of EXTERN to MODULE_SCOPE (defined in
	this file too to be 'extern' if not overridden) as nothing declared in
	tclInt.h is supposed to be visible outside the Tcl core. If there *is*
	anything that extensions are actually using, we can open this up later
	on. [Patch 1055668]

	* doc/CrtChannel.3 (Tcl_GetChannelMode): Add synopsis. [Bug 1058446]

2004-11-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (FromCTime, TclpUtime): Replaced a call to the
	Posix 'utime' function with calls to Windows-API equivalents, to avoid
	a bug where the VC++ versions misconvert times across a Daylight
	Saving Time boundary. [Bug 926106]
	* win/tclWinInt.h (TclWinProcs):
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (asciiProcs, unicodeProcs): Removed now-unused
	reference to 'utime'.
	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-24.12): Added test case for the above bug.

2004-11-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Make INST_EQ and friends
	handle NaN correctly in all cases. [Bug 761471]

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespaceInscopeCmd): Make the error message
	generation the same as in NamespaceEvalCmd().
	(Tcl_Import): Rationalized to use Tcl_EvalObjv().

2004-10-31  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/io.test (io-40.3): Convert umask2 test constraint into a form
	that most people will be able to satisfy.

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-8.45): Removed broken test constraint. It
	didn't do what it was intended to do, and it implied the other correct
	constraint. [Bug 1053908]

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoGlobalsCmd):
	* tests/info.test (info-8.4): Strip leading global-namespace
	specifiers from the pattern argument. [Bug 1057461]

2004-10-30  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/clock.c: Replaced WIN32 macro with __WIN32__. [Bug 1054357].
	Thanks to David Gravereaux for the patch.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Removed a long-standing bug that causes incorrect
	conversion between file time and UTC time if the file time is recorded
	in a different Daylight Saving Time status than the current one. [Bug
	926106]

2004-10-29  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Correct reaction to errors in the
	obsolete processCmdLineArgsHook.	[Bug 1055673]
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:	Bump to tcltest 2.2.7
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* tests/all.tcl:	Update to use [tcltest::configure].

2004-10-29  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* library/tm.tcl (::tcl::tm::*): Use the core proc engine to generate
	the wrong-num-args error messages for the path ensemble.

	Ensembles can now (sometimes) rewrite the error messages of their
	subcommands so they appear more like the arguments that the user
	passed to the ensemble. Below is a description of changes involved in
	doing this.

	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-50.*): Tests of ensemble subcommand
	error message rewriting.
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclObjInterpProc): Make procedures implement
	their wrong-num-args message using Tcl_WrongNumArgs instead of
	something baked-at-home.
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclIsEnsemble, NsEnsembleImplementationCmd):
	Added test of ensemble-hood (available to rest of core) and made
	ensembles set up the rewriting for Tcl_WrongNumArgs to take advantage
	of.
	* generic/tclInt.h (Interp.ensembleRewrite): Extra fields.
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_WrongNumArgs): Add knowledge of what is
	going on in ensembles' command rewriting so this command can generate
	the right error message itself.
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp, TclEvalObjvInternal): Added
	code to initialize (as empty) the rewriting fields and reset them when
	we leak outside an ensemble implementation.

2004-10-28  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_START_CMD):
	* tests/execute.test (execute-8.3): fix for execution stack corruption
	[Bug 1055676]. Credit dgp for detective work and fix.

2004-10-27  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test (socket-13.1):	Balanced [makeFile] and
	[removeFile] commands.

	* tests/clock.test:	Correct duplicate test names.
	* tests/namespace.test:
	* tests/string.test:
	* tests/io.test (io-50.4):	Use namespace variables.

2004-10-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:	  The following 9 functions were moved from
	* generic/tclInt.h:	  tclInt.h to the private/int Stubs table for
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:  use by the test suite. As tclTest.obj is
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:  linked to the shell, these functions need
	"blessed" status so as to always be exported from the library. Being
	placed in the Stubs table guarantees this [Bug 1054748]:
		TclpObjRemoveDirectory,	TclpObjCopyDirectory,
		TclpObjCreateDirectory,	TclpObjDeleteFile,
		TclpObjCopyFile,	TclpObjRenameFile,
		TclpObjStat,		TclpObjAccess,
		TclpOpenFileChannel

	* tests/registry.test:	Fixed test files to load the correct
	* tests/winDde.test:	registry and dde packages by using the info
	* win/Makefile.in:	from makefiles to tell tcltest where to load
	* win/makefile.vc:	them from. This avoids grabbing the wrong
	package from $auto_path which might be the install point rather than
	the dev location. Kudos to Jennifer Hom for adding -load and
	-loadfile to the tcltest package. [Bug 926088]

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclFinalizeLock): release the critical section
	before deleting it. [Bug 731778]

	* generic/tcl.h: Removed the file level 'extern "C" {' and the
	coresponding closing block as it serves no purpose given that all the
	function prototypes have the proper extern usage already.

	* unix/tclAppInit.c:	When built as tcltest, TclThread_Init was
	* win/tclAppInit.c:	getting called twice. First by Tcltest_Init,
	then again in Tcl_AppInit. The call from Tcl_AppInit is now removed.

2004-10-27  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/tm.test:  Expanded on the testsuite entered by Donal.
	* library/tm.tcl: Even found bugs, these have been corrected.

2004-10-26  Kevin Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/format.test (format-19.1): Additional regression test for [Bug
	868489].

2004-10-27  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/*.n: Many small general documentation fixes.

2004-10-26  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCleanupChildren): bad cast of resolvedPid
	caused PIDs on win95 to go negative. winpipe-4.2 brought this to the
	surface. Fixed with sprintf in place of TclFormatInt. Thanks to hgiese
	[Patch 767676]

2004-10-26  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/tm.tcl (::tcl::tm::Defaults): Added a second [file dirname]
	around the location of the executable. This fixes [Bug 1038705].
	Instable of a bogus "foo/bin/lib" we now have the correct "foo/lib" as
	a base path for modules.

2004-10-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_SubstObj):	Fix for failed subst-12.3 test
	* tests/subst.test (subst-12.3-5):	More tests for Bug 1036649.

	* unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Updated the installation of
	the http, msgcat, and tcltest packages to install as Tcl Modules on
	Unix systems. Other platform Makefiles still need updating. [Patch
	1054370]

	* tests/basic.test:	Added missing constraints.
	* tests/compile.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:

	* tests/init.test (init-2.8):	Updated to not rely on http package.

2004-10-26  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclVar.c: removed more direct references to the VAR flags,
	replaced with access macros.

2004-10-26  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/expr.n: Clarified that non-num/non-bool literals require
	quoting. [Bug 1027849]. Also listed booleans as acceptable values.

2004-10-26  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl (FreeScan): Fixed a bug that caused relative days
	of the week in free-form [clock scan] to be evaluated in the wrong
	time zone.
	* tests/clock.test (clock-31.[456]): Made sure that there isn't an
	env(TZ) or env(TCL_TZ) lying around that will override the time zone
	that we're trying to establish with the simulated registry.
	Both problems reported as [Bug 1054101].

2004-10-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/string.n (map): Rewrote to clarify that we don't just map single
	characters. [Bug 1048005]
	* doc/info.n (procs): Clarified that the pattern argument may have
	namespace separators in it. [Bug 1047928]

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-8.45): Simplify in the hope that the reasons
	for [Bug 1053908] will become clearer.

2004-10-25  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (IllegalExprOperandType,TclExecuteByteCode):
	Removed several DECACHE_INFO/CACHE_INFO pairs that are no longer
	needed for protection because routines like Tcl_SetErrorCode() and
	Tcl_AddErrorInfo() can no longer re-enter bytecode execution.

	* generic/tclResult.c (TclProcessReturn): Bug fix. Be sure that a
	missing -errorinfo option when code == TCL_ERROR causes the errorInfo
	field to get reset.

	* tests/thread.test (thread-4.4): Test depended on a ::errorInfo value
	initialized to "". Added code to test to setup that requirement.

	* library/auto.tcl:	Purged Tcl's script library of all
	* library/clock.tcl:	remaining references to global vars
	* library/init.tcl:	::errorInfo and ::errorCode.

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main): Updated to make use of
	TclGetReturnOptions instead of ::errorInfo variable.

	* generic/tclInterp.c (tclInit): Bug fix. Access dict variables with
	[dict get], not array syntax.

2004-10-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/tm.test: Rewrote the tests to actually perform syntax checks
	on the public API. Added a new test (currently failing) to indicate
	that the test suite is not complete yet.
	* library/tm.tcl (path): Rewrote to turn this command into an ensemble
	to make it faster and simpler.

2004-10-24  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclTrace.c: defined new macros to get/set the flags of
	variables. The only files that still access the flag values directly
	are tclCompCmds.c, tclCompile.c, tclProc.c and tclVar.c

2004-10-24  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_LogCommandInfo,Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo): Shift
	the initialization of errorCode to NONE to more central location.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (BgError,Tcl_BackgroundError,HandleBgErrors):
	Rewrite to build on the new TclGet/SetReturnOptions routines.

	* generic/tclResult.c (TclGetReturnOptions): Add call to
	Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo to be sure error fields are initialized.

	* generic/tclResult.c (TclTransferResult): Rewrite to build on the new
	TclGet/SetReturnOptions routines.

2004-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/tm.n: Tightened up the documentation.
	* tests/tm.test: Created (with partially dummy content) so TIP#189 can
	be marked Final.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NsEnsembleImplementationCmd): Make ensembles
	cut their implementations out of error traces. This is the right thing
	to do more often than not.

2004-10-22  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl: Fixed a typo where the fallback time zone became
	::localtime instead of :localtime. Fixed a bug where time zone names
	containing hyphens could not be loaded.
	* tests/clock.test: Added regression test cases that covers both bugs.
	Thanks to Todd M. Helfter <tmh@jumpgate.itsp.purdue.edu> for finding
	these bugs.

2004-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj, Tcl_ExprObj):
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclProcCompileProc): Always call object
	freeIntRepProc's in the same way.

2004-10-22  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: fixed bug in commit of 2004-07-23, which was
	causing a leak of Proc structures and failure of compile-12.1. Two
	lines were 'zombies' from the previous way localVarNames worked.
	Credit dgp for finding this.

2004-10-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (Interp):
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp,Tcl_DeleteInterp):
	* generic/tclResult.c (GetKeys,ReleaseKeys,etc.): Moved the key values
	of the return options dictionary out of private fields of the Interp
	struct and into thread-static values managed in tclResult.c.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_CatchObjCmd, Tcl_ErrorObjCmd): Updated to
	call the new TclGet/SetReturnOptions routines to do much of their
	work.

	* generic/tclInt.h (TclGetReturnOptions,TclSetReturnOptions):
	* generic/tclResult.c (TclGetReturnOptions,TclSetReturnOptions): New
	utility routines to get/set the return options of an interp. Intent is
	that these routines will be converted to public routines after TIP
	approval.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclProcessReturn,TclMergeReturnOptions):
	* generic/tclResult.c (TclProcessReturn,TclMergeReturnOptions): Move
	internal utility routines from tclCmdMZ.c to tclResult.c.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp, Tcl_DeleteInterp):
	* generic/tclResult.c (TclTransferResult): Rework so that
	iPtr->returnOpts can be NULL when there are no special options.

	* generic/tclResult.c (TclRestoreInterpState): Plug potential memory
	leak.

2004-10-21  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Various changes to [clock format] that,
	* generic/tclClock.c: together, make it roughly twice as fast
	* generic/tclInt.h:   while all tests in the test suite
	* library/clock.tcl:  continue to pass.

2004-10-20  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/Makefile.in (install-msgs):   Fixed a problem with the
	* win/Makefile.in (install-tzdata): installation of timezone data and
	message catalogs. They used the installed tcl library directory, not
	the source library. Before it was installed. Switched to source lib
	dir. Thanks to Kevin for the help in figuring this out.

2004-10-20  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (ThreadEventProc): Corrected subtle bug
	where the returned (char *) from Tcl_GetStringResult(interp) continued
	to be used without copying or refcounting, while activity on the
	interp continued. That's not safe, and recent changes demonstrated the
	lack of safety with failing tests thread-4.3 and thread-4.5.

2004-10-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictWithCmd): Make sure all paths (that are
	not themselves error paths) do not lose the result code.

2004-10-19  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (Tcl*InterpState):		New internal routines
	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl*InterpState):	TclSaveInterpState,
	TclRestoreInterpState, and TclDiscardInterpState are superior
	replacements for Tcl_(Save|Restore|Discard)Result. Intent is that
	these routines will be converted to public routines after TIP
	approval. Interfaces for these routines were shamelessly stolen from
	Itcl.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjvInternal):
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictUpdateCmd, DictWithCmd):
	* generic/tclIOGT.c (ExecuteCallback):
	* generic/tclTrace.c (Trace*Proc,TclCheck*Traces,TclCallVarTraces):
	Callers of Tcl_*Result updated to call the new routines. The calls
	were relocated in several cases to perform save/restore operations
	only when needed.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (HandleBgErrors):
	* generic/tclFCmd.c (CopyRenameOneFile): Calls to Tcl_*Result that
	were eliminated because they appeared to serve no useful purpose,
	typically saving/restoring an error message, only to throw it away.

2004-10-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp,Tcl_DeleteInterp):
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_CatchObjCmd):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclMergeReturnOptions,TclProcessReturn):
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj):
	* generic/tclInt.h (Interp):
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclUpdateReturnInfo): Place primary storage of
	the -level and -code information in private fields of the Interp
	struct, rather than in a DictObj. This should significantly improve
	performance of TclUpdateReturnInfo.

2004-10-17  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclResult.c: removed unused variable [Bug 1048588]. Thanks
	to Daniel South.

2004-10-15  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclProcessReturn):	Now that primary
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclUpdateReturnInfo):	storage for the
	errorInfo and errorCode values are internal fields, we can set them at
	the time of the [return] command, and not have to wait until the
	specified number of "-level"s have popped.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp, Tcl_DeleteInterp)
	(TclEvalObjvInternal, Tcl_LogCommandInfo, TclAddObjErrorInfo):
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_CatchObjCmd):
	* generic/tclEvent.c (BgError, ErrAssocData, Tcl_BackgroundError)
	(HandleBgErrors, BgErrorDeleteProc):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCreateExecEnv, TclDeleteExecEnv):
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (comments only):
	* generic/tclInt.h (ExecEnv,Interp, ERR_IN_PROGRESS):
	* generic/tclInterp.c ([tclInit]):
	* generic/tclMain.c (comments only):
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_CreateNamespace, Tcl_DeleteNamespace)
	(TclTeardownNamespace):
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclUpdateReturnInfo):
	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_ResetResult, TclTransferResult):
	* generic/tclTrace.c (CallVarTraces):
	Reworked management of the "errorInfo" data of an interp. That
	information is now primarily stored in a new private (Tcl_Obj *) field
	of the Interp struct, rather than using a global variable ::errorInfo
	as the primary storage. The ERR_IN_PROGRESS flag bit value is no
	longer required to manage the value in its new location, and is
	removed. Variable traces are established to support compatibility for
	any code expecting the ::errorInfo variable to hold the information.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Code that sets traces on the ::errorInfo variable may notice a
	difference in timing of the firing of those traces. Code that uses the
	value ERR_IN_PROGRESS.

2004-10-14  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	TIP#217 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsortObjCmd): Add -indices option from James
	Salsman. [Patch 1017532]

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclMatchIsTrivial): Detect degenerate cases of
	glob matching that let us avoid scanning through hash tables.
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoCommandsCmd, InfoGlobalsCmd, InfoProcsCmd):
	(InfoVarsCmd): Use this to speed up some [info] subcommands.

2004-10-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/tzdata/America/Campo_Grande:
	* library/tzdata/America/Cuiaba:
	* library/tzdata/America/Sao_Paulo
	* library/tzdata/America/Argentina/Mendoza:
	* library/tzdata/America/Argentina/San_Juan:
	Synchronized to Olson's 'tzdata2004e'.

2004-10-08  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	TIP#201 AND TIP#212 IMPLEMENTATIONS

	* doc/dict.n, doc/expr.n: Documentation for new functionality.
	* tests/expr.test: Basic tests of 'in' and 'ni' behaviour.
	* tests/dict.test (dict-21.*,dict-22.*): Tests for [dict update] and
	[dict with].
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Implementation of the
	INST_LIST_IN and INST_LIST_NOT_IN bytecodes.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (GetLexeme): Parse the 'in' and 'ni'
	operators for TIP#201.
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictUpdateCmd,DictWithCmd): Core of
	implementation of TIP#212; docs and tests still to do...

2004-10-07  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestsetobjerrorcodeCmd):  Simplified.

2004-10-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclPathObj.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/winFCmd.test: code reorganization for better generic/platform
	code splitting [Bug 925620] removing the need for several #ifdef's,
	and tests and fix for an unreported Windows glob problem ('glob -dir
	C: -tails *').

2004-10-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* *.3: Convert CONST to const and VOID to void so we document how
	people should actually use the Tcl API and not the compatibility hacks
	that it has to have.

	* doc/man.macros, *.3: Update .AS macro so it can know how wide to
	make the third column of the argument list. Update documentation for C
	API (only users) to take advantage of this.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: Formatting fixes for greater documentation
	clarity.

2004-10-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (DoGlob, TclGlob): Stop messy sharing of
	interpreter result and instead use a private object for collecting the
	result of the glob. This simplifies TclGlob quite a lot.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory): Simplify by removing
	some nesting. Also standardize variable names.
	(FsAddMountsToGlobResult): Force updates to the list to be done
	in-place, putting a side-condition of non-shared-ness on the resultPtr
	argument to Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory, but everything would have broken
	before if that was shared *anyway*.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (LoadTableEncoding): Removed reference to Tcl
	interpreter; it wasn't needed as direct object use is more efficient.

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: Made this file follow the style rules in the
	Engineering Manual more closely, and also take advantage of the
	internal object manipulation macros more.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd): Reorganized to have fewer
	magic flag variables and to separate the code that scans for a match
	from the code that processes a match body.

	It is a poor practice to directly set or append to the value of the

	that circumstance a Tcl_Panic() will be the result. Searched for
	example of this practice and replaced with safer alternatives, often
	using the Tcl_AppendResult() routine that dkf just rehabilitated.
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl: Bump to dde 1.3.1
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl: Bump to registry 1.1.5

2004-10-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/SetResult.3: Made Tcl_AppendResult non-deprecated; better that
	people use it than most of the common alternatives!
	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_AppendResultVA): Make this work better with
	Tcl_Objs. [Patch 1041072]
	(Tcl_SetResult, Tcl_AppendElement): Change string to stringPtr to
	avoid C++ keywords.

2004-10-05  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclObjInvoke): More simplification of the
	TclObjInvoke routine toward unification with the rest of the
	evaluation stack.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp, Tcl_DeleteInterp)
	(TclEvalObjvInternal, Tcl_LogCommandInfo):

	(TclTeardownNamespace):
	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_ResetResult, Tcl_SetObjErrorCode)
	(TclTransferResult):
	* generic/tclTrace.c (CallVarTraces):
	Reworked management of the "errorCode" data of an interp. That
	information is now primarily stored in a new private (Tcl_Obj *) field
	of the Interp struct, rather than using a global variable ::errorCode
	as the primary storage. The ERROR_CODE_SET flag bit value is no longer
	required to manage the value in its new location, and is removed.
	Variable traces are established to support compatibility for any code
	expecting the ::errorCode variable to hold the information.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Code that sets traces on the ::errorCode variable may notice a
	difference in timing of the firing of those traces.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_PopCallFrame): Removed Bug 1038021
	workaround. That bug is now fixed.

2004-10-04  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test (clock-34.*): Removed an antibug that forced
	comparison of [clock scan] results with the :localtime time zone. Now
	that [clock scan] uses the current time zone instead, the antibug
	caused several tests to fail. [Bug 1038554]

2004-10-04  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (GetLexeme): Ensure that the 'eq' and 'ne'
	operators are followed by non-alphabetic characters so lexemes can't
	run together. [Bug 884830]

	* doc/DictObj.3, doc/dict.n: Clarified that a dictionary is not
	order-preserving. [Bug 1032243] Also added another example to show off
	more ways of using a dictionary and a few other formatting
	improvements.

2004-10-02  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (TraceDictPath, Tcl_DictObjPutKeyList): Add
	support for automatic creation of dictionary paths since that is what
	everyone seems to actually expect of the API! [Bug 1037235]
	(Tcl_DictObjNext): Make calling this after Tcl_DictObjDone non-fatal
	as that simplifies a number of internal APIs. This doesn't break any
	existing working code as it is a case which previously caused a panic.

2004-10-02  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-8.7):	Another test for save/restore
	of ::errorInfo and ::errorCode during global namespace teardown.

2004-10-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclObjGetFrame, Tcl_UplevelObjCmd):
	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UpvarObjCmd): Cache stackframe level
	references in the level object for speed.

2004-09-30  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp):
	* generic/tclInt.h (Interp): Removed the flag bit value
	EXPR_INITIALIZED. It was set during interp creation and never tested.
	Whatever purpose it had is in the past.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjEx):	Removed the flag bit value
	* generic/tclInt.h (Interp):	        USE_EVAL_DIRECT. It was used
	* generic/tcLTest.c (TestevalexObjCmd): only in the testing command
	* tests/parser.test (parse-9.2):        [testevalex] and nothing in
	the test suite made use of the capability it enabled.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo): More re-organization
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ErrorObjCmd):	    of the management of
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclProcessReturn):    the errorCode value.
	* tests/error.test (error-6.4-9):

	* generic/tclNamespace.c (TclTeardownNamespace): Tcl_Obj-ified
	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-8.5,6):	 the save/restore of
	::errorInfo and ::errorCode during global namespace teardown. Revised
	the comment to clarify why this is done, and added tests that will
	fail if this is not done.

	* generic/tclResult.c (TclTransferResult): Added safety checks so that
	unexpected undefined ::errorInfo or ::errorCode will not lead to a
	segfault.

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TclCallVarTraces):  Save/restore the flag values
	* tests/var.test (var-16.1):	          that define part of the
	interpreter state during variable traces. [Bug 1038021].

2004-09-30  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* win/tcl.dsp:
	Continued refactoring of [clock] for TIP 173 changes. Broke the
	free-form parser apart so that the Bison parser is responsible for
	only parsing, while clock.tcl handles relative times like "next
	Thursday", "next January". This change is needed to make timezones
	other than :localtime and :Etc/UTC work with free-form scanning. This
	change closes out the issue identified as being "for another day" in
	my log message of 2004-09-08. The refactored code also eliminates the
	last known references to TclpStrftime and TclGetDate, so those
	routines (including compat/strftime.c) have been removed. The
	refactoring also has the benefit that all storage in the Bison parser
	is now on the C stack, eliminating any need for mutex protection
	around [clock scan]. Also, changed the Makefiles so that 'make
	gendate' is available on Windows as well as Unix.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Removed some grubby
	* generic/tclObj.c (SetBooleanFromAny):	 work-around code that was
	needed only because of Bug 868489.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclObjInvoke): Removed three unused variables to
	silence a compiler warning in VC++.

2004-09-27  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in (clean): Fixup make clean rule so that it
	does not delete all files when SHLIB_SUFFIX is set to the empty string
	in a static build. [Bug 1016726]

2004-09-23  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Corrections to the 2004-09-21 commit
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	regarding ERR_ALREADY_LOGGED. That commit
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	caused Tk test send-10.7 to fail. Added
	* tests/namespace.test (25.7,8): tests in the Tcl test suite
	* tests/pkg.test (2.25,26):	 to catch this error without the aid
	of Tk in the future.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ExprObjCmd):	Simplified the TclObjCmdProc
	of [expr] with a call to Tcl_ConcatObj.

2004-09-22  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclProcessReturn):	Support the -errorline
	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript):	option to [return].
	* tests/compile.test (16.23.*):	Use that capability to defer reporting
	* tests/misc.test (1.2):	of parse errors until runtime. Updated
	tests to reflect change. [Bug 1032805]

2004-09-22  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_START_CMD):
	* tests/proc.test (7.2-3): fix for [Bug 729692] was incorrect whenever
	a loop exception was returned.

2004-09-22  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/tzdata/America/Montevideo: Updated to reflect
	ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tzdata2004d.tar.gz. (Changes to
	Asia/Jerusalem were in the comments only.) [Routine maintenance - no
	bug] Spanish-language description of the change at
	http://www.presidencia.gub.uy/decretos/2004091502.htm

2004-09-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:	Tolerate [append] syntax errors
	* tests/appendComp.test (8.1):	at compile time, and allow runtime to
	raise the error (or succeed if a redefined [append] allows).

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Reworked management of the interp flag
	* generic/tclCompile.c:	ERR_ALREADY_LOGGED, to reduce its exposure.
	* generic/tclExecute.c: Still left several referebces that are just
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	too nice on performace to do away with.	These
	changes also resolve an inconsistency in the ::errorInfo values
	produced by [namespace eval x error foo bar] and [namespace eval x
	{error foo bar}].

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj):	Simplified the
	TclCompEvalObj routine. Much housekeeping now reliably happens
	elsewhere. [Patch 1031949]

2004-09-21  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/interp.n: Tighten up wording on how [interp eval] and [interp
	invokehidden] operate w.r.t. stack frames. [Bug 926590]

2004-09-20  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/error.test (error-6.2,3):	Added more tests to verify
	::errorCode setting by/after a [catch].

2004-09-19  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: removed outdated comment [Bug 1029518].

2004-09-18  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Dde package can load into a safe interp. Claim
	this fact for the Tcl_StaticPackage() call when the shell is built
	with the TCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES option.

2004-09-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC-INST_LSHIFT,INST_RSHIFT): Ensure that
	large shifts end up shifting correctly. [Bug 868467]

	* doc/FileSystem.3, doc/OpenFileChnl.3: More documentation fixes from
	Mikhail Kolesnitchenko. [Patch 1022527]
	* doc/*: Standardize highlighting of symbols defined in tcl.h

2004-09-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo, Tcl_LogCommandInfo):
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c ([catch], [error]):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c ([return]):
	* generic/tclProc.c (TclUpdateReturnInfo):
	* generic/tclResult.c (Tcl_SetErrorCodeVA, Tcl_SetObjErrorCode)
	(TclTransferResult):	Refactored so that all errorCode setting flows
	through Tcl_SetObjErrorCode(). This greatly reduces the number of
	different places in the code that need to know details about an
	internal bitflag field of the Interp struct. Also places errorCode
	setting in one place for easier future mods.

2004-09-17  Kevin B.Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclDate.c:	Revised tclGetDate.y to use bison instead of
	* generic/tclGetDate.y: yacc to build the parser, eliminating all the
	* generic/tclInt.h:	complicated hackery involving 'sed'
	* unix/Makefile.in:	postprocessing. Rebuilt the parser.

2004-09-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c (ClockOldscanObjCmd): Silenced a compiler warning
	(long passed as a param where unsigend long was expected). 'Unsigned
	long' is wrong, but the fix is really to change the signature of
	TclGetDate to return a structure of its 'yy' variables and then do the
	remaining work inside clock.tcl. But, as I said on 2004-09-08, that's
	a job for another day. [Bug 1027993]

2004-09-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/interp.n:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (TclPreventAliasLoop, AliasCreate):
	* tests/interp.test (17.4-6, 19.3-4): fixing problems with renaming of
	aliases [Bugs 707104 1026493]. Fix designed by dgp.

2004-09-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NsEnsembleImplementationCmd): Add token field
	to internal rep of EnsembleCmdRep structure so that we can check it to
	see if the subcommand object is really being used with the same
	ensemble. [Bug 1026903]

2004-09-11  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c (TclMktimeObjCmd): Corrected a bad check for
	error return from 'mktime'.
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetIntFromObj): Corrected a problem where
	demoting a wide to an int failed on a big-endian machine. [Bug
	1026125].
	* tests/clock.test (clock-43.1): Added regression test for error
	return from 'mktime'.

2004-09-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_CONCAT1): fix for [Bug 1025834]; avoid
	unnecessary string copies.

2004-09-10  David Gravereaux <davyrgvy@pobox.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test: tcltest-12.3-4 needed to have
	::tcltest::loadScript set to empty in their -setup

2004-09-10  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclObj.c (SetIntOrWideFromAny): Rewritten integral value
	parsing code so that values do not flip so easily between numeric
	representations. Thanks to KBK for this! [Bug 868489]

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Seek): Make sure wide seeks do not fail to set
	::errorCode on error. [Bug 1025359]

2004-09-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Micro formatting fixes.
	* generic/tclIOGT.c: Channel version fixed, must be 3, to have
	wideseekProc. Thanks to David Graveraux <davygrvy@pobox.com>.

2004-09-11  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamespace.c (TclGetNamespaceForQualName): Resolved
	longstanding inconsistency in the treatment of the TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY
	flag revealed by testing the 2004-09-09 commits against Itcl.
	TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY now acts as specified in the pre-function comment,
	forcing resolution in the passed in context namespace. It has been
	incorrectly forcing resolution in the interp's current namespace.

2004-09-10  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl: Fixed a bug where %z always put a plus sign on
	the time zone in :localtime.
	* tests/clock.test: Added test case for the above bug.

2004-09-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_CONCAT1): added a peephole optimisation
	for concatting an empty string. This enables replacing the idiom 'K $x
	[set x {}]' by '$x[set x {}]' for fastest execution.

2004-09-09  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: Calls to WriteFile and WriteConsoleA changed to
	WriteConsole for simplicity.

2004-09-09  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_ForgetImport):	Corrected faulty

	* tests/namespace.test: logic that relied exclusively on string
	matching and failed in the presence of [rename]s. [Bug 560297] Also
	corrected faulty prevention of [namespace import] cycles. [Bug 1017299]

2004-09-08  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp):	Removed obsolete field
	for storing the string-based command procedure of built-in commands.
	We no longer have any string-based built-in commands!

2004-09-08  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strftime.c (_conv): Corrected a problem where hour 0 would
	format as a blank format group with %k.
	* doc/clock.n: Corrected a buglet in the header information. [Bug
	1024058]
	* generic/tclClock.c (TclClockMktimeObjCmd): Fixed a bug where the
	month was scanned incorrectly in -timezone :localtime.
	* tests/clock.test (clock-34.*,clock-40.1, clock-41.1): Adjusted the
	clock-34.* test cases so that the consistency check is performed in
	:localtime rather than the current time zone. This change allows
	dealing with issues where the C library has a different idea of DST
	conversion than Tcl. (Real fix would be to break TclGetDate into
	separate parser and time converter, and do the time conversion in
	clock.tcl. That's for another day.) Added regression test case for the
	bug where month was scanned incorrectly in -timezone :localtime. [Bug
	1023779] Added regression test case for %k at the zero hour.

2004-09-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: some quoting needed to be removed as it was
	breaking with VC7. [Bug 1023150]

2004-09-07  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n: Documented the default -format, and changed references
	to a (nonexistent) msgcat command to refer to the msgcat package. [Bug
	1023870]
	* generic/tclTimer.c: Removed a premature optimisation that attempted
	to store the assoc data in the client data; the optimisation caused a
	bug that [after] would overwrite its imports. [Bug 1016167]
	* library/clock.tcl (InitTZData, ClearCaches): Changed so that the
	in-memory time zone :UTC (and its aliases) always gets reinitialised,
	in case tzdata is absent. [Bug 1019537, 1023779]
	* library/tzdata/*: Regenerated.
	* tests/clock.test (clock-31.*, clock-39.1): Corrected a problem where
	the 'system' locale tests fail on a non-English Windows machine. [Bug
	1023761]. Added a test to make sure that alias time zones load
	correctly. [Bug 1023779].
	* tests/timer.test (timer-1.1, timer-2.1): Changed to (one hopes!) be
	more resilient on an overloaded system, if [after 200] sleeps for 300
	ms or longer.
	* tools/tclZIC.tcl (writeLinks): Corrected a problem where alias time
	zone names were written incorrectly, causing them to fail to load at
	run time. [Bug 1023779].
	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_GetTime): Eliminated CPUID tests on Win64 -
	assuming that HAL vendors now do a better job of keeping the
	performance counters synchronized among CPU's. [Bug 1020445]

2004-08-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	command token to get the name of the ensemble for passing to the
	-unknown handler instead of relying on objv[0], which may contain
	useless info in the presence of [namespace import]. Problem found by
	Don Porter when investigating [Bug 1016167].

	well as the $::auto_path. [RFE 695441]

2004-08-21  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test (clock-38.1): Changed TZ setting to specify CET in
	excruciating detail to deal with systems that lack the Posix defaults
	for DST changes (and to be formally correct with the change dates for
	CET).

2004-08-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	constraint and the comments that refer to it.

2004-08-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/init.tcl: Integrated TIP #189. We source a separate file
	(see below), instead of inlining the contents of that file. This
	should beeasier to maintain, and easier to backport/install in 8.4
	installations.

	Note: Usage of Tcl Modules is restricted to non-safe interps. It
	cannot be loaded into a safe interp.

	* library/tm.tcl: New file, the v2 reference implementation for TIP
	#189, Tcl Modules.

	* doc/tm.n: New file, documentation for Tcl Modules, based on the TIP.

	* unix/mkLinks: Regenerated.
	* win/makefile.vc: Added tm.tcl to list of files to install.

		Implementation of TIPs #173 and #209.

	The [clock] command is now a Tcl ensemble, with most of its
	functionality written in Tcl and callouts to C code only to access
	low-level functions such as localtime, mktime and tzset.

	In addition to the functionality changes called out in the two TIPs,
	it is worth noting that the [clock] command in a safe slave
	interpreter is now an alias to the [clock] command in the master, and
	that [clock] is otherwise not expected to function entirely correctly
	in safe interps. C code that simply does Tcl_MakeSafe needs to be
	aware that [clock] may need special handling. (It appears unlikely
	that such code actually exists.)

	One incompatibility of note is that if the time zone cannot be
	determined from the TZ, TCL_TZ environment variables, or from the
	Windows control panel, so that the C library must be used for date and
	time conversions, then times outside the range of time_t will fail;
	they used to return bad data silently.

	Many thanks to all the many people who assisted with testing,
	debugging, criticism of the specification, and localisation. Deserving
	of particular mention are Joe English, Clif Flynt, Donal K. Fellows,
	Jeff Hobbs, Cameron Laird, Arjen Markus, Reinhard Max, Christopher
	Nelson, Steve Offutt, Donald G. Porter, Pascal Scheffers, Peter da
	Silva and Richard Suchenwirth-Bauersachs.

2004-08-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	Added checks to prevent [mclocale]
	* tests/msgcat.test:	from registering filesystem paths to possibly
	malicious code to be evaluated by a later [mcload].

2004-08-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpThreadCreate): changed handling of the
	returned thread ID since broken on 64-bit systems (Cray). Thanks to
	Rob Ratcliff for reporting the bug.

2004-08-03  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (MakeCachedEnsembleCommand): Initialize the
	epoch field cached in the subcommand. [Bug 989298]
	(NsEnsembleImplementationCmd): Plug a leak (thanks to Miguel Sofer for
	spotting it with valgrind) and reduce the number of goto labels to
	make the code clearer.

2004-08-02  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl (pkg_mkIndex):	Updated [pkg_mkIndex] to make
	use of [glob -directory $dir -tails] and return options.

	TIP#207 IMPLEMENTATION

	* doc/interp.n:		Added support for a -namespace option to the
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	[interp invokehidden] command.	Also added an
	* generic/tclInt.h:	internal routine TclObjInvokeNamespace() and
	* generic/tclInterp.c:	corrected the flag names TCL_FIND_ONLY_NS and
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	TCL_CREATE_NS_IF_UNKNOWN that are passed to the
	* generic/tclTrace.c:	internal routine TclGetNamespaceForQualName().
	* tests/interp.test:	[Patch 981841]

	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclCleanupLiteralTable):	Corrected
	* tests/compile.test (compile-12.4):	flawed deletion of literal
	internal reps that could lead to accessing of freed memory. Thanks to
	Kevin Kenny for test case and fix [Bug 1001997].

2004-07-30  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/safe.test (safe-2.1):  Disabled senseless test.	 [Bug 999612]

	* library/auto.tcl (auto_reset):  Removed "protected" list of commands
	from [auto_reset]. All entries in the auto_index can be re-loaded.
	* library/package.tcl: Updated comment to reflect 2004-07-28 commit.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize):	Re-organized Tcl_Finalize so
	that Tcl_ExitProc's that call Tcl_Finalize recursively do not cause
	deadlock. [Patch 999084 fixes Tk Bug 714956]

2004-07-30  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Darwin: instead of setting PLAT_OBJS
	to explict object files in tcl.m4, refer to MAC_OSX_OBJS makefile var.
	* unix/Makefile.in: added MAC_OSX_OBJS variable.

2004-07-29  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl: [::pkg::create] is now an alias. Test safe-2.1
	will now fail until Bug 999612 is corrected.

2004-07-28  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:		Moved private command
	* library/tclIndex:		[pkg_compareExtension] into ::tcl::Pkg.
	* tests/pkg_mkIndex.test:	Also moved implementation of
	[::pkg::create] to [::tcl::Pkg::Create].

2004-07-25  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Make io-61.1 create file as binary to pass on Win32

2004-07-23  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: simplify tclLocalVarNameType, removing the
	reference to the corresponding proc. The reference is now seen as
	unnecessary, and it may cause leaking circular references under some
	circumstances (see for example [Bug 994838]).

2004-07-22  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/eofchar.data (removed): Test io-61.1 now generates its own
	* tests/io.test:	file of test data as needed.

2004-07-20  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c:	    Correct threaded obj allocator to
	* generic/tclInt.h:	    fully cleanup on exit and allow for
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: reinitialization. [Bug 736426]
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:	    (mistachkin, kenny)
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:

2004-07-21  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (DeleteInterpProc):
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclCleanupLiteralTable):
	* generic/tclInt.h: added a TclCleanupLiteralTable function, called
	from DeleteInterpProc, that frees internal representations of shared
	literals early when an interpreter is being deleted. This change
	corrects a number of memory mismanagement issues in the cases where
	the internal representation of one literal contains a reference to
	another, and avoids conditions such as resolved variable names
	referring to procedure and namespace contexts that no longer exist.
	[Bug 994838]

2004-07-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: added 'install-private-headers' makefile target to
	allow optionally installing private tcl headers. [FR 922727]

	* macosx/Makefile: use new 'install-private-headers' target to install
	private headers into framework. [FR 922727]

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c (NativeMatchType): added support for readonly
	matching of user immutable files (where available).

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c: dynamically acquire address for
	CFBundleOpenBundleResourceMap symbol, since it is only present in full
	CoreFoundation on Mac OS X and not in CFLite on pure Darwin.

2004-07-19  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclwinThrd.c: redefined MASTER_LOCK to call TclpMasterLock.
	Fixes [Bug 987967]

2004-07-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to rare 'cd' infinite loop in normalization
	with vfs [Bug 991420].
	* tests/fileSystem.test: added test for above bug.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: clarified documentation of posix error codes in
	'remove directory' FS proc - 'EEXIST' is used to signify a non-empty
	directory error (bug reported against tclvfs).

2004-07-16  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in, unix/tcl.m4:     move (C|LD)FLAGS after their
	* unix/configure.in, unix/configure: _DEFAULT to allow for env setting
	to override m4 switches. Move SC_MISSING_POSIX_HEADERS up and
	consolidate calls to limit redundancy in configure.
	(CFLAGS_WARNING): Remove -Wconversion
	(SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Set m4 to force threaded build when built against
	a threaded Tcl core.

2004-07-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_FcopyObjCmd): Corrected a typo in the
	generation of error messages and simplified by reusing data in a
	variable instead of retrieving the string again. Fixes [Bug 835289].

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: Added description of the behaviour of
	Tcl_ReadChars when its 'charsToRead' argument is set to -1. Fixes [Bug
	934511].

	* doc/CrtCommand.3: Added note that the arguments given to the command
	proc of a Tcl_CreateCommand are in utf8 since Tcl 8.1. Closing [Patch
	414778].

	* doc/ChnlStack.3: Removed the declaration that the interp argument to
	Tcl_(un)StackChannel can be NULL. This fixes [Bug 881220], reported by
	Marco Maggi <marcomaggi@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* tests/socket.test: Accepted two new testcases by Stuart Casoff
	<stwo@users.sourceforge.net> checking that -server and -async don't go
	together [Bug 796534].

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (NotifierThreadProc): Accepted Joe Mistachkin's
	patch for [Bug 990500], properly closing the notifier thread when its
	exits.

2004-07-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpFinalizeMutex): Accepted Joe Mistachkin's
	patch for [Bug 990453], closing leakage of mutexes. They were not
	destroyed properly upon finalization.

2004-07-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.h (CHANNEL_INCLOSE):	   New flag. Set in
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_UnregisterChannel): 'Tcl_Close' while the
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Close):		   close callbacks are
	run. Checked in 'Tcl_Close' and 'Tcl_Unregister' to prevent recursive
	call of 'close' in the close-callbacks. This is a possible error made
	by implementors of virtual filesystems based on 'tclvfs', thinking
	that they have to close the channel in the close handler for the
	filesystem.

2004-07-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclIO.h:
	* Not reverting, but #ifdef'ing the changes from May 19, 2004 out of
	the core. This removes the ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for channel
	drivers it introduced. This has become possible due to Expect gaining
	a BlockModeProc and now handling blockingg and non-blocking modes
	correctly. Thus [SF Tcl Bug 943274] is still fixed if a recent enough
	version of Expect is used.

	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Added warning about usage of a channel without a
	BlockModeProc.

2004-07-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_PutsObjCmd): Added length check to the old
	depreceated newline syntax, to ensure that only "nonewline" is
	accepted. [Tcl SF Bug 985869], reported by Joe Mistachkin
	<mistachkin@users.sourceforge.net>.

2004-07-15  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): stuffed memory leak incurred by
	re-initializing of TSD slots after the last call to
	TclFinalizeThreadData (done from within Tcl_FinalizeThread()). We
	basically just repeat the TclFinalizeThreadData() once more before
	tearing down TSD keys in TclFinalizeSynchronization(). There should be
	more elaborate mechanism in place for handling such issues, based on
	thread cleanup handlers registered on the OS level. Such change
	requires much more work and would also require TIP because some
	visible parts of Tcl API would have to be modified. In the meantime,
	this will do.

	* generic/tclNotify.c (TclFinalizeNotifier): Added conditional
	notifier finalization based on the fact that an TclInitNotifier has
	been called for the current thread. This fixes the [Bug 770053] again.
	Hopefully this time w/o unwanted side-effects.

2004-07-15  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclReleaseLiteral): Removed unused variable
	'codePtr' to silence a message from VC++.

2004-07-15  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript):
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclReleaseLiteral): fix for [Bug 467523],
	which resurfaced with the latest changes. The previous strategy was to
	have special code in TclReleaseLiteral to handle the self-references
	generated by empty scripts. The new approach avoids the self-reference
	altogether, by having empty scripts return an unshared literal.

2004-07-15  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (NewThreadProc): Backout of changes to fix the
	[Bug 770053]. See SF bugreport for more info.

2004-07-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx): leak fix by dgp, release
	objv[objectsUsed] on error.

2004-07-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_SubstObj): leak fix by dgp, release result
	on error.

2004-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (BuildEnsembleConfig): Don't forget to clean out
	references when deleting the hash table.
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (Tcl_DictObjRemoveKeyList): Oops, forgot to
	delete value object when removing the hash entry. [Bug 989093 in part]

2004-07-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC): fixed leak of expandNestList objs when
	there is an error while an expansion is in progress (code added at
	checkForCatch).

2004-07-11  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to 'cd' bug when vfs is active [tclvfs Bug
	986944] - this bug recently introduced by some threading fixes. Need
	to work out how to add tests for this.

2004-07-10  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test (clock-2.11): Changed the test so that it isn't an
	infinite loop when run under valgrind on a slow virtual machine.
	Thanks to Miguel Sofer for the bug report. Also put in code to restore
	env(LC_TIME) after tests complete, silencing a warning from 'make
	TESTFLAGS="-debug 1" test'.

2004-07-08  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (DeleteInterpProc): reverted the modification of
	3 days ago, as the leak of [Bug 983660] is now handled by the change
	in TclCleanupByteCode.
	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCleanupByteCode): let each bytecode remove
	its references to literals at interp deletion, without updating the
	dying literal table.
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclDeleteLiteralTable): with the above change
	to TclCleanupByteCode, this function now removes a single reference to
	the literal object and cleans up its own structures.

2004-07-08  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinInit.c (AppendEnvironment): Silenced a compilation warning
	about a type mismatch.

2004-07-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): fix for [Bug 458361].
	Single-word scripts are compiled with an unshared cmdName to avoid
	shimmering between bytecode and cmdName reps.

2004-07-07  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclMergeReturnOptions):  Simplified logic and
	removed potential memory leak. [Bug 986257].

2004-07-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tools/man2help2.tcl (setTabs, IPmacro): Added support for the more
	advanced *roff macros used in Tk's doc/bind.n

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclInitObjSubsystem): Declare all current object
	types.

2004-07-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-return-2.17): Added a test that a word
	containing backslash-quoted value is treated correctly.

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclWordKnownAtCompileTime): [Bug 986196]
	Corrected flaw above and the flaw that caused TCL_TOKEN_SIMPLE_WORDs
	to have their original word value copied ( "{a b}" ) rather than the
	actual value ( "a b" ). Thanks to Kevin Kenny for report and tests.

2004-07-06  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-return-2.15,cmdMZ-return-2.16): Added a test
	that a return code containing spaces is correctly returned.

2004-07-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tools/man2html2.tcl (IPmacro, setTabs): Added support for the more
	advanced *roff macros used in Tk's doc/bind.n

2004-07-05  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (DeleteInterpProc): fix for [Bug 983660], found
	by pspjuth. Tear down the global namespace before freeing the interp
	handle, to allow the bytecodes to free their non-shared literals.
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclReleaseLiteral): moved special code for
	self-ref so that it is also used for non-shared literals. Possible bug
	found by inspection.

2004-07-03  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprRoundFunc):
	* tests/expr-old.test (39.1): added support for wide integers to
	round(); [Bug 908375], reported by Hemang Lavana.

2004-07-03  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Moved declaration of TclCompEvalObj() from
	tclCompile.h to the internal stubs table, for compiler
	experimentation.

2004-07-02  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/regcomp.c (stid): correct minor pointer size error

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): applied TIP #202 patch that
	* doc/exec.n, tests/exec.test:		 adds 2>@1 as a special case
	redirection of stderr to the result output.

2004-07-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/io.test: Changed several tests to run the event loop rather
	than just calling [update] periodically, avoiding intermittent
	failures (usually in io-29.32) that stemmed from unreaped processes on
	Windows.
	* tests/winPipe.test (winpipe-1.11): Fixed a bug that caused test to
	fail if the path name of the working directory contained whitespace
	[Bug 678430]

2004-07-01  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test: Added test for [Bug 970529]

2004-07-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* win/README.binary, win/README: Updated references to Tcl and Tk 8.4
	to point to 8.5 instead. Thanks to Theo Verelst for spotting this.
	* generic/tcl.h: Added note to help prevent those changes from getting
	missed in the future.

	* doc/Namespace.3, doc/load.n, doc/Limit.3: Typo fixes and remove
	duplicate documentation. [Bug 983146]

2004-06-30  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test: Minor correction to new fileSystem-9.X tests
	so that they clean up temporary directories correctly.

2004-06-30  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/filename.n: clarified behaviour concerning trailing slashes in
	filenames [Bug 971976]

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix and tests for [Bug 979879]

2004-06-30  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	TIP#188 IMPLEMENTATION

	* doc/string.n, tests/string.test:	 Add 'wideinteger' to things
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): that can be tested for with
	the [string is] subcommand. [Patch 940915, by Kevin Kenny]

2004-06-29  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinInit.c:	Corrected reference counting flaw in recent
	changes. Thanks to Pat Thoyts. [Bug 981893].

2004-06-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: fix to compilation with VC++ 5.2

2004-06-29  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* library/safe.tcl: Make sure that the temporary variable is local to
	the namespace and not inadvertently global. [Bug 981733]

2004-06-24  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: Modified constraints so that testing with a
	threaded tclsh (not tcltest) will not hang.

2004-06-23  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclThreadStorage.c: Corrected type casting errors that led
	to calculation of a negative index value, thus accesses outside the
	threadStorageCache array, thus memory corruption. Crash observed on
	Mac OS X platform.

2004-06-23  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tclThread.c: Implements platform independent thread storage
	* generic/tclThreadStorage.c: mechanism and fixes associated bugs on
	platforms where there is limited thread local storage space
	(Win98/WinNT4). [Patch 976496]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: Added thread storage functions to the
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: internal stubs table.

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/Makefile.in: Modified the unix, VC++, and Cygwin build systems
	* win/configure: to include the new "tclThreadStorage.c" and the new
	* win/tcl.m4: USE_THREAD_STORAGE define.

2004-06-23  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Added -force to 18.1 and 18.2. This was failing on
	WinXP.

	* tests/winFCmd.test: Added a cleanup to winFCmd-16.11 to avoid a
	failure in 16.12.

	* tests/eofchar.data: Added -kb option to ensure a binary checkout to
	win32 systems. This fixes a failure in io-61.1

	* win/makefile.vc: fix for [Bug 977369] about launching tclsh to
	generate a tclConfig.sh with the nmake build system

2004-06-23  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/winDde.test (createChildProcess): Added a 200-ms delay (with
	the event loop live) when shutting down the test DDE server process.
	With the delay in place, nuisance failures of tests winDde-4.2, -6.5,
	and -6.6 appear to be much less frequent. [Bug 957449]

2004-06-23  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/*.test: Standardize use of platform constraints.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (GetStackSize, TclpCheckStackSpace):
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpThreadGetStackSize): Added code to check
	whether the C stack is about to be exceeded, from [Patch 746378] by
	Joe Mistachkin but with substantial revisions.

2004-06-22  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (NewThreadProc): Fixed broken build on Windows
	caused by missing TCL_THREAD_CREATE_RETURN.

	* tests/stack.test (stack-3.1): Corrected nuisance error in threaded
	builds.

2004-06-22  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: [Bug 770053]. See bug report for more information
	about what it does.

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: rewritten to use tcltest::threadReap to
	gracefully wait for the test thread to exit. Otherwise we got a race
	condition with main thread exiting before the test thread. This
	exposed the long-standing Tcl lib issue with resource
	garbage-collection on application exit.

2004-06-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (DllMain, _except_dllmain_detach_handler)
	(TclpCheckStackSpace, _except_checkstackspace_handler)
	(TclWinCPUID, _except_TclWinCPUID_detach_handler):
	* win/tclWinChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel)
	(_except_makefilechannel_handler):
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, _except_dorenamefile_handler)
	(DoCopyFile, _except_docopyfile_handler):
	Rework pushing of exception handler function pointer so that compiling
	with gcc -O3 works. Remove empty function call to avoid compiler
	warning. Mark the DllMain function as noinline to avoid compiler error
	from duplicated asm labels in generated code.

2004-06-21  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (Ptr2Block): Rewrote so as to maximize the
	chance of detecting and reporting a memory inconsistency without
	relying on things being consistent. [Bug 975895]

2004-06-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/load.test:	Relaxed strictness of error message matching
	for test load-2.3 so that it will pass on Mac OSX.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Static TclFindEncodings -> FindEncodings.
	* generic/tclInt.h:	Updated TclpFindExecutable() so that failed
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	attempts to find the executable are saved
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:	just as successful finds are. [Patch 966053]
	* unix/tclUnixTest.c:

2004-06-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/winFCmd.test (winFCmd-16.12): Changed test to compute the
	target directory, so as not to fail if the user's HOME isn't the root.

2004-06-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: autoconf 2.5 fixes in Darwin section.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.57

2004-06-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (localeTable): Added some more locale to encoding
	mapping info from Jim Huang <jserv@kaffe.org>

	* generic/tclInt.h (PendingObjData,TclFreeObjMacro,etc):
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclFreeObj): Added scheme for making TclFreeObj()
	avoid blowing up the C stack when freeing up very large object trees.
	[Bug 886231]

	* win/tclWinInit.c (SetDefaultLibraryDir): Fix logic, simplify and add
	comments.

2004-06-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Added missing space in panic message.

	* win/tclWinInit.c:	Inform [tclInit] about the default library
	directory via the ::tclDefaultLibrary variable. This should correct a
	problem with my 2004-06-11 commit. Better solutions still in the
	works. Thanks to Joe Mistachkin for pointing out the breakage.

2004-06-16  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/library.n:	Moved variables ::auto_oldpath and
	* library/auto.tcl:	::unknown_pending into ::tcl namespace.
	* library/init.tcl:	[Bugs 808319, 948794]

2004-06-15  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/binary.n: Added some notes to the documentation of the 'a'
	format to address the point raised in [RFE 768852].

2004-06-15  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in (TCL_EXTRA_CFLAGS): set to @CFLAGS@, which is
	the configure-time CFLAGS. Addendum to m4 change on 2004-05-26.

2004-06-14  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/Makefile.in: Corrected compilation flags for tclPkgConfig.c so
	that it doesn't require Stubs.
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp): Removed comment stating that
	TclInitEmbeddedConfigurationInformation needs Stubs; with the change
	above, the comment is now erroneous.

2004-06-11  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Encoding.3:	Removed bogus claims about tcl_libPath.

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_Init):	Stopped setting the
	tcl_libPath variable. [tclInit] can get all its directories without it.

	* tests/unixInit.test:	Modified test code that made use of
	tcl_libPath variable.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:	Stopped setting the tclDefaultLibrary variable,
	execept on the Mac OS X platform with HAVE_CFBUNDLE. In that
	configuration we should seek some way to make use of the TIP 59
	facilities and get rid of that usage of tclDefaultLibrary as well.

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Updated [tclInit] to make $env(TCL_LIBRARY) an
	absolute path, and to include the scriptdir,runtime configuration value
	on the search path for init.tcl.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:	The routines Tcl_Init() and TclSourceRCFile()
	* win/tclWinInit.c:	had identical implementations for both win and
	* generic/tclInterp.c:	unix. Moved to a single generic implementation.
	* generic/tclMain.c:
	* library/init.tcl:
	* generic/tclInitScript.h (removed):
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/tcl.dsp:

	* unix/configure.in:	Updated TCL_PACKAGE_PATH value to handle
	* win/configure.in:	--libdir configuration.

	* unix/configure.in:	autoconf-2.57
	* win/configure.in:

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp): Moved call to
	TclInitEmbeddedConfigurationInformation() earlier in
	Tcl_CreateInterp() so that other parts of interp creation and
	initialization may access and use the config values.

2004-06-11  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Restored the 'setargv' procedure when compiling
	with mingw. Apparently, the command line parsing in mingw doesn't work
	as well as that in vc++, and the result was (1) that winPipe-8.19
	failed, and (2) that 'make test' would work at all only with
	TESTFLAGS='-singleproc 1'. [Bug 967195]

2004-06-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: removed forceful setting of the private cached
	current working directory rep from within the Tcl_FSChdir(). We
	delegate this task to the Tcl_FSGetCwd() which does this task anyway.
	The relevant code is still present but disabled temporarily until the
	change proves correct. The Tcl test suite passes all test with the
	given change so I suppose it is good enough.

2004-06-10  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):	Disabled addition of
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):	relative-to-executable
	directories to the library search path. A first step in reform of
	Tcl's startup process.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Attempts to directly run ./tclsh or ./tcltest out of a build directory
	will either fail, or will make use of an installed script library in
	preference to the one in the source tree. Use `make shell` or `make
	runtest` instead.

	* tests/unixInit.test:	Modified tests to suit above changes.

	* generic/tclPathObj.c:	Corrected [file tail] results when operating
	on a path produced by TclNewFSPathObj(). [Bug 970529]

2004-06-09  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: partially corrected [Bug 932314]. Also
	corrected return values of Tcl_FSChdir() to reflect those of the
	underlying platform-specific call. Originally, return codes were mixed
	with those of Tcl.

2004-06-08  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: handle warning [Bug 969066]

2004-06-08  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclHash.c (RebuildTable): Move declaration of variable so it
	is only declared when it is used. [Bug 969068]

2004-06-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n: Added correct option to example. [Bug 968219]

2004-06-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tcl.h: Corrected Tcl_WideInt declarations so that the mingw
	build works again.
	* generic/tclDecls.h:			Changes to the tests for clock
	* generic/tclInt.decls:			frequency in Tcl_WinTime so
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:		that any clock frequency is
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:		accepted provided that all
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:		CPU's in the system share a
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:		common chip, and hence,
	* tests/platform.test (platform-1.3):	presumably, a common clock.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclWinCPUID):	This change necessitated a
	* win/tclWinTest.c (TestwincpuidCmd)	small burst of assembly code
	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_GetTime):	to read CPU ID information,
	which was added as TclWinCPUID in the internal Stubs. To test this
	code in the common case of a single-processor machine, a
	'testwincpuid' command was added to tclWinTest.c, and a test case in
	platform.test. Thanks to Jeff Godfrey and Richard Suchenwirth for
	reporting this bug. [Bug 976722]

2004-06-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Restored #include <stdio.h> to tcl.h,
	rejecting the "fix" for "Bug" 945570. Tcl_FSSeek() needs the values of
	SEEK_SET, etc. and too many extensions rely on tcl.h providing stdio.h
	for them.

2004-06-02  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpFindExecutable): when using GetModuleFileNameA
	(Win9x), convert from CP_ACP to WCHAR then convert back to utf8.
	Adjunct to 2004-04-07 fix.

2004-06-02  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tests/winPipe.test (winpipe-6.1): blocking set to 1 before closing
	to ensure we get an exitcode. The windows pipe channel driver doesn't
	differentiate between a blocking and non-blocking close just yet, but
	will soon. Part of [Bug 947693]

2004-06-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n: fix to documentation of 'file volumes' (Bug 962435)

2004-06-01  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: check for either MSDEVDIR or MSVCDIR being in the
	environment, for VC7. [Bug 942214]

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelOption): -buffersize wasn't
	understanding hexidecimal notation nor was reporting number conversion
	errors. The behavior to silently ignore settings outside the
	acceptable range of Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize (<10 or >1M) is
	unchanged. This silent ignoring behavior might be up for review soon.

2004-05-30  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:  Reworked the win implementation of Tcl_WaitPid to
	support exitcodes in the 'signed short' range. Even though this range
	is non-portable, it is valid on windows. Detection of exception codes
	are now more accurate. Previously, an application that exited with
	ExitProcess((DWORD)-1); was improperly reported as exiting with
	SIGABRT.

2004-05-30  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c: Added comments describing the purposes of each
	function in the limit implementation and rewrote the names of some
	non-public functions for greater clarity of purpose.
	* doc/interp.n: Added note about what happens when a limited
	interpreter creates a slave interpreter.
	* doc/Limit.3: Added manual page for the resource limit subsystem's C
	API. [Bug 953903]

2004-05-29  Joe English	 <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/global.n, doc/interp.n, doc/lrange.n: Fix minor markup errors.

2004-05-28  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/*.n: Added examples to many (too many to list) more man pages.

2004-05-25  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: using (ptrdiff_t) instead of (int) casting to
	correct compiler warnings [Bug 961657], reported by Bob Techentin.

2004-05-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test: Added a single test for the presence of %G in
	[clock format], and conditioned out the clock-10.x series if they're
	all going to fail because of a broken strftime() call. [Bug 961714]

2004-05-27  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclHash.c (CompareStringKeys): Added #ifdef to allow people
	to instruct this function to use strcmp(). [FRQ 951168]

	* generic/tclVar.c: Moved declarations into #if guards so they only
	happen when required.
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: Guard declaration of strtod() so it is only
	enabled when we don't have a declaration in stdlib.h
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (Tcl_CreateThread):	Added declarations
	* unix/tclUnixTest.c (AlarmHandler):		and casts so that
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtyModemStatusStr):	all functions are
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd):		defined before use
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (InvalidateDictChain):	and no cross-type
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd):	uses are performed.

	The overall effect is to make building with gcc with the additional
	flags -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes produce no increase in
	the total number of warnings (except for main(), which is undeclared
	for traditional reasons.)

2004-05-26  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in:  Rework configure ordering to TCL_LINK_LIBS,
	* unix/tcl.m4:	     ENABLE_SHARED, CONFIG_CFLAGS, & ENABLE_SYMBOLS
	* unix/configure:    before TCL_EARLY_FLAGS and TCL_64BIT_FLAGS
	* unix/configure.in: (about 400 lines earlier) in configure.in. This
	forces CFLAGS configuration to be done before many tests, which is
	needed for 64-bit builds and may affect other builds. Also make
	CONFIG_CFLAGS append to CFLAGS directly instead of using EXTRA_CFLAGS,
	and have LDFLAGS append to any existing value. [Bug 874058]
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: change EXTRA_CFLAGS to DEFS

2004-05-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Correction to debug prints and testing
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:	if TCLTEST_OPTIONS value. Corrected
	* tests/tcltest.test:		double increment of numTestFiles in
	-singleproc 1 configurations. Updated tcltest-19.1 to tcltest 2.1
	behavior. Corrected tcltest-25.3 to not falsely report a failure in
	tcltest.test. Bumped to tcltest 2.2.6. [Bugs 960560, 960926]

2004-05-25  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/http.n (http::config): add -urlencoding option (default utf-8)
	* library/http/http.tcl:     that specifies encoding conversion of
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl: args for http::formatQuery. Previously
	* tests/http.test:	     undefined, RFC 2718 says it should be
	utf-8. 'http::config -urlencoding {}' returns previous behavior, which
	will throw errors processing non-latin-1 chars. Bumped http package to
	2.5.0.

2004-05-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (DeleteScriptLimitCallback): Move all deletion
	of script callback hash table entries to happen here so the entries
	are correctly removed at the right time. [Bug 960410]

2004-05-25  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* docs/global.n: added details for qualified variable names [Bug
	959831]

2004-05-25  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_FindNamespaceVar):
	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-17.10-12): reverted commit of
	2004-05-23 and removed the tests, as it interferes with the varname
	resolver and there are apps that break (AlphaTk). A fix will have to
	wait for Tcl9.

	* generic/tclVar.c: Caching of namespace variables disabled: no simple
	way was found to avoid interfering with the resolver's idea of
	variable existence. A cached varName may keep a variable's name in the
	namespace's hash table, which is the resolver's criterion for
	existence.

	* tests/namespace.c (namespace-17.10): testing for interference
	between varname caching and name resolver.

2004-05-25  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: Correct test for the presence of a CD-ROM so
	that it doesn't misdetect some other sort of filesystem with a
	write-protected root as being a CD-ROM drive. [Bug 918267]

2004-05-25  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winPipe.test:	Protect against path being set
	* tests/unixInit.test:	Unset path when done.
	* tests/unload.test (unload-3.1): Verify [pkgb_sub] does not exist.
	Delete interps when done.
	* tests/stringComp.test:	stop re-use of string.test test names
	* tests/regexpComp.test:	stop re-use of regexp.test test names
	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-46.3): Verify [p] does not exist.
	* tests/http.test:	Clear away the custom [bgerror] when done.
	* tests/io.test:	Take care to use namespace variables.
	* tests/autoMkindex.test (autoMkindex-5.2): Use variable "result"
	that gets cleaned up.
	* tests/exec.test:	Clean up the "path" array.
	* tests/interp.test (interp-9.3): Initialize res, so prior values
	cannot make the test fail.
	* tests/execute.test (execute-8.1):  Updated to remove the trace set
	on ::errorInfo. When left in place, that trace can cause later tests
	to fail.

2004-05-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Removed references to Tcl_RenameCommand from
	* generic/tcl.h:      comments. [Bug 848440, second part]

	* tests/fCmd.test: Rewrote tests that failed consistently on NFS so
	they either succeed (through slightly more liberal matching of the
	results) or are constrained to not run. [Bug 931312]

	* doc/bgerror.n: Use idiomatic open flags for working with log
	files. [Bug 959602]

2004-05-24  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (VerifyExprObjType): use GET_WIDE_OR_INT to
	properly have tclIntType used for smaller values. This corrects [TclX
	Bug 896727] and any other 3rd party extension that created math
	functions but was not yet WIDE_INT aware in them.

2004-05-24  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (TclInitLimitSupport): Made limits work on
	platforms where sizeof(void*)!=sizeof(int). [Bug 959193]

2004-05-24 Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/set.n: accurate description of name resolution process,
	referring to namespace.n for details [Bug 959180]

2004-05-23  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_FindNamespaceVar): [Bug 959052] fixed,
	insuring that no "zombie" variables are found.
	* generic/tclVar.c (TclLookupSimpleVar): comments re [Bug 736729]
	(predecessor of [Bug 959052]) removed.
	* tests/namespace.test: added tests 17.10-12

	The patch modifies non-documented behaviour, and passes every test in
	the testsuite. However, scripts relying on the old behaviour may
	break.
	Note that the only behaviour change concerns the creative writing of
	unset variables. More precisely, which variable will be created when
	neither a namespace variable nor a global variable by that name
	exists, as defined by [info vars]. The new behaviour is that the
	namespace resolution process deems a variable to exist exactly when
	[info vars] finds it - ie, either it has value, or else it was "fixed"
	by a call to [variable].
	Note: this patch was removed on 2002-05-25.

2004-05-22  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclObjLookupVar, TclObjUnsetVar2): fix for new (in
	tcl8.4) exteriorisations of [Bug 736729] due to the use of
	tclNsVarNameType obj types. Reenabling the use of this objType ("VAR
	ref absolute" benchmark down to 66 ms, from 230). Added comments in
	TclLookupSimpleVar explaining my current understanding of [Bug
	736729].

2004-05-22  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: fix for [Bug 735335]. The use of tclNsVarNameType
	objs is still disabled, pending resolution of [Bug 736729].

2004-05-21  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-41.3): removed the {knownBug}
	constraint: [Bug 231259] is closed since nov 2001, and the fix of [Bug
	729692] (INST_START_CMD) makes the test succeed.

2004-05-21  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Move a few declarations a
	short distance so pre-C99 compilers can cope. Also fix so
	TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG path compiles...

2004-05-21  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): reorganised TEBC
	automatic variables, defining them in tight blocks instead of at the
	function level. This has three purposes:
	- it simplifies the analysis of individual instructions
	- it is preliminary work to the non-recursive engine
	- it allows a better register allocation by the optimiser; under
	gcc3.3, this results in up to 10% runtime in some tests

2004-05-20  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (TclLimitRemoveAllHandlers):
	* generic/tclBasic.c (DeleteInterpProc):
	* tests/interp.test (interp-34.7): Ensure that all limit callbacks are
	deleted when their interpreters are deleted. [Bug 956083]

2004-05-19  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): fix for an issue where
	there was a sneak path from Tcl_DStringFree to SetErrorCode(0). The
	result was that the error code could be reset between a call to
	FindFirstFileEx and the check of its status return, leading to a
	bizarre error return of {POSIX unknown {No error}}. (Found in
	unplanned test - no incident logged at SourceForge.)

2004-05-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/interp.test (interp-34.3): Rewrite this test to see if a time
	limit can catch a tight bytecode loop, a maximally aggressive
	denial-of-service attack.
	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_LimitCheck): Fix the sense of checks to see
	whether a time limit has been extended.

	* tests/*.test: Many minor fixes, including ensuring that every test
	is run (so constraints control whether the test is doing anything) and
	making sure that constraints are always set using the API instead of
	poking around inside tcltest's internal datastructures. Also got rid
	of all trailing whitespace lines from the test suite!

2004-05-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Fixed [SF Tcl Bug 943274]. This is the same problem
	* generic/tclIO.h: as [SF Tcl Bug 462317], see ChangeLog entry
	2001-09-26. The fix done at that time is incomplete. It is possible to
	get around it if the actual read operation is defered and not executed
	in the event handler itself. Instead of tracking if we are in an read
	caused by a synthesized fileevent we now track if the OS has delivered
	a true event = actual data and bypass the driver if a read finds that
	there is no actual data waiting. The flag is cleared by a short or
	full read.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for channel drivers.

2004-05-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to (Bug 956063) in 'file dirname'.
	* tests/cmdAH.test: added test for this bug.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: better documentation of refCount requirements of
	some FS functions (Bug 956126)

2004-05-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestgetintCmd): Made the tests in get.test check
	* tests/get.test:		     Tcl_GetInt() since the core now
					     avoids that function.

2004-05-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strftime.c (_fmt, ISO8601Week):
	* doc/clock.n:
	* tests/clock.test: Major rework to the handling of ISO8601 week
	numbers. Now passes all the %G and %V test cases on Windows, Linux and
	Solaris [Bugs 500285, 500389, and 852944]

2004-05-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/append.n, doc/upvar.n: Added example.

2004-05-18  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: now generates a tclConfig.sh from Pat Thoyts [Patch
	909911]

2004-05-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n: Improve clarity (based on [Patch 955361] by Peter
	Spjuth)

	* tools/man2help2.tcl (macro,SHmacro): Added support for subsection
	(.SS) header macros.

	* doc/interp.n: Added user documentation for the TIP#143 resource
	limits and some examples.

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_LimitCheck, Tcl_LimitTypeReset): Reset the
	limit-exceeded flag when removing a limit.

2004-05-18  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): added comments to
	classify the variables according to their use in TEBC.

2004-05-17  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/global.n, doc/uplevel.n: Added an example.

	* tests/info.test (info-3.1): Corrected test result back to what it
	used to be in Tcl 7.* now that command counts are being correctly kept

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC:INST_START_CMD): Make sure that the
	command-count is always advanced. Allows TIP#143 limits to tell that
	work is being done.

	* doc/list.n: Updated example to fit with the unified format.
	* doc/seek.n: Added some examples.

2004-05-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* tests/cmdAH.test: fix to (Bug 954263) where 'file executable' was
	case-sensitive.

2004-05-17  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: Documented type of 'offset' argument to Tcl_Seek
	was wrong. [Bug 953374]

2004-05-16  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): remove one level of
	indirection for compiledLocals addressing.

2004-05-16  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_CALL_FUNC1): bugfix; restored
	(DE)CACHE_STACK_INFO pair around the call - the user defined math
	function could cause a recursive call to TEBC.

2004-05-16  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteInterp):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_START_CMD): interp deletion now modifies
	the compileEpoch, eliminating the need for the check for interp
	deletion in INST_START_CMD.

2004-05-16  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: changed implementation of {expand}, last
	chance while in alpha as ...

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	Scripts precompiled with ProComp under previous tcl8.5a versions may
	malfunction due to changed instruction numbers for
	INST_LIST_INDEX_IMM, INST_LIST_RANGE_IMM and INST_START_CMD.

2004-05-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:	     Promoted TclpLocaltime and TclpGmtime
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:     from Unix-specific stubs to the generic
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: internal Stubs table. Reran 'genstubs'
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:

	* generic/tclClock.c: Changed a buggy 'GMT' timezone specification
			      to the correct 'GMT0'. [Bug 922848]

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: Moved TclpGmtime and TclpLocaltime to
			      unix/tclUnixTime.c where they belong.

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c (TclpGmtime, TclpLocaltime, TclpGetTimeZone,
			      ThreadSafeGMTime [removed],
			      ThreadSafeLocalTime [removed],
			      SetTZIfNecessary, CleanupMemory):
	Restructured to make sure that the same mutex protects all calls to
	localtime, gmtime, and tzset. Added a check in front of those calls to
	make sure that the TZ env var hasn't changed since the last call to
	tzset, and repeat tzset if necessary. [Bug 942078] Removed a buggy
	test of the Daylight Saving Time information in 'gettimeofday' in
	favor of applying 'localtime' to a known value. [Bug 922848]

	* tests/clock.test (clock-3.14): Added test to make sure that changes
	to $env(TZ) take effect immediately.

	* win/tclWinTime.c (TclpLocaltime, TclpGmtime): Added porting layer
	for 'localtime' and 'gmtime' calls.

2004-05-14  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h: the math functions receive a pointer to top of
	the stack (tosPtr) instead of the execution environment (eePtr). First
	step towards a change in the execution stack management - it is now
	only used within TEBC.

2004-05-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	TIP#143 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj, TclExecuteByteCode):
	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjvInternal): Enable limit checking.
	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_Limit*): Public limit API.
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* tests/interp.test: Basic tests of command limits.

	* doc/binary.n:		TIP#129 IMPLEMENTATION [Patch 858211]
	* generic/tclBinary.c:	Note that the test suite probably has many more
	* tests/binary.test:	failures now due to alterations in constraints.

2004-05-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	Optimisations for INST_START_CMD [Bug 926164].
	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): avoid emitting
	INST_START_CMD as the first instruction in a bytecoded Tcl_Obj. It is
	not needed, as the checks are done before calling TEBC.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): runtime peephole
	optimisation: check at INST_POP if the next instruction is
	INST_START_CMD, in which case we fall through.

2004-05-11  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/split.n, doc/join.n: Updated examples and added more.

2004-05-11  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/glob.n: documented behaviour of symbolic links with 'glob -types
	d' (Bug 951489)

2004-05-11  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/scan.n: Updated the examples to be clearer about their relevance
	to the scan command.

2004-05-10  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/scan.n: Added examples.

2004-05-10  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Moved non-obvious appending
	logic to outside the loop and added commentary for its purpose. Also
	use the existence of contents in the linePtr rather than the scratch
	DString post the append, as this more clear.

	(TclpCreateProcess): When under NT, with no console, and executing a
	DOS application, the path priming does not need an ending space as
	BuildCommandLine() will do this for us.

2004-05-08  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: remove some compiler warnings on MacOS X.

2004-05-07  Chengye Mao <chengye.geo@yahoo.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: refixed bug 789040 re-entered in rev 1.41. Let's
	be careful and don't re-enter previously fixed bugs.

2004-05-08  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/format.n: Added examples.

2004-05-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/unset.n: added upvar.n to the "see also" list

2004-05-07  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* tests/encoding.test: added support and tests for translating
	embedded null characters between real nullbytes and the internal
	representation on input/output [Bug 949905].

2004-05-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix for [Bug 943995], in which vfs-registered
	root volumes were not handled correctly as glob patterns in all
	circumstances.

2004-05-06  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c (TclFreeObj): made TclFreeObj use the new macro
	TclFreeObjMacro(), so that the allocation and freeing of Tcl_Obj is
	defined in a single spot (the macros in tclInt.h), with the exception
	of the TCL_MEM_DEBUG case.
	The #ifdef logic for the corresponding macros has been reformulated to
	make it clearer.

2004-05-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/break.n, doc/continue.n, doc/for.n, doc/while.n: More examples.

2004-05-05  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.10):	Test correction for Mac OSX.
	Be sure to consistently compare normalized path names. Thanks to
	Steven Abner (tauvan). [Bug 948177]

2004-05-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtObjCmd.3: Remove reference to Tcl_RenameCommand; there is no
	such API. [Bug 848440]

2004-05-05  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketEventProc) : connect errors should fire both
	the readable and writable handlers because this is how it works on
	UNIX [Bug 794839]

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFinalizeEncodingSubsystem):
	FreeEncoding(systemEncoding); moved to before the hash table iteration
	as it was causing a double free attempt under some conditions.

	* win/coffbase.txt: Added the tls extension to the list of preferred
	load addresses.

2004-05-04  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/fileSystem.test (filesystem-1.39): replace 'file volumes'
	* tests/fileName.test (filename-12.9,10):  lindex with direct C:/
	hard-coded because A:/ was being used and that is empty for most.

	* tests/winFCmd.test (winFCmd-16.12): test volumerelative $HOME

2004-05-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c:		Make sure Tclp*Alloc* routines get
	* generic/tclInt.h:		declared in the TCL_MEM_DEBUG and
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c:	TCL_THREADS configuration. [Bug 947564]

	* tests/tcltest.test:	Test corrections for Mac OSX. Thanks to Steven
	Abner (tauvan). [Bug 947440]

2004-05-04  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclSetLibraryPath): Suppress a warning.

2004-05-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* Applied [Patch 868853], fixing a mem leak in TtySetOptionProc.
	Report and Patch provided by Stuart Cassoff <stwo@users.sf.net>.

2004-05-03  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclCreateProc): comments corrected.

2004-05-03  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): setting the compilation
	namespace outside of the loop.

2004-05-03  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: reverted fix for [Bug 926445] of 2004-04-02,
	restoring TCL_ALIGN to the header file. Todd Helfter reported that the
	macro is required by tbcload.

2004-05-03  Kevin Kenny	 <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace):
	* tests/stack.test (stack-3.1): Fix for undetected stack overflow in
	TclReExec on Windows. [Bug 947070]

2004-05-03  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl:	Corrected unique prefix matching of
	interactive command completion in [unknown]. [Bug 946952]

2004-05-02  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclObjInvokeProc):
	* tests/proc.test (proc-3.6): fix for bad quoting of multi-word proc
	names in error messages [Bug 942757]

2004-04-30  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/glob.n, doc/incr.n, doc/set.n:	More examples.
	* doc/if.n, doc/rename.n, doc/time.n:

2004-04-30  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:		Replaced Kevin Kenny's temporary
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c:	fix for Bug 945447 with a cleaner,
	more permanent replacement.

2004-04-30  Kevin B. Kenny   <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: Added a temporary (or so I hope!)
	inclusion of "tclWinInt.h" to avoid problems when compiling on
	Win32-VC++ with --enable-threads. [Bug 945447]

2004-04-30  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/puts.n: Added a few examples.

2004-04-29  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/execute.test (execute-8.2):	Avoid crashes when there is
	limited system stack space (threads-enabled).

2004-04-28  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/global.n:
	* doc/upvar.n:
	* generic/tclVar.c (ObjMakeUpvar):
	* tests/upvar.test (upvar-8.11):
	* tests/var.test (var-3.11): Avoid creation of unusable variables:
	[Bug 600812] [TIP 184].

2004-04-28  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n: Fixed fault in documentation of -index option [943448]

2004-04-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TclpObjNormalizePath):  Corrected improper
	positioning of returned checkpoint. [Bug 941108]

2004-04-26  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/open.n, doc/close.n: Updated (thanks to David Welton) to be
	clearer about pipeline errors and added example to open(n) that shows
	simple pipeline use. [Patches 941377,941380]

	* doc/DictObj.3: Added warning about the use of Tcl_DictObjDone and an
	example of use of iteration. [Bug 940843]

	* doc/Thread.3: Reworked to remove references to testing interfaces
	and instead promote the use of the Thread package. [Patch 932527]
	Also reworked and reordered the page for better readability.

2004-04-25  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Removed obsolete declarations and #include's.
	* generic/tclInt.h:	[Bugs 926459, 926486]

2004-04-24  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (DllMain): Added DisableThreadLibraryCalls() for
	the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH case. We're not interested in knowing about
	DLL_THREAD_ATTACH, so disable the notices.

2004-04-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPort.h:
	* macosx/Makefile:
	* unix/Makefile.in: followup on tcl header reform [FR 922727]: removed
	use of relative #include paths in tclPort.h to allow installation of
	private headers outside of tcl source tree; added 'unix' dir to
	compiler header search path; add newly required tcl private headers to
	Tcl.framework on Mac OSX.

2004-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelOption): Fixed [SF Tcl Bug 930851].
	When changing the eofchar we have to zap the related flags to prevent
	them from prematurely aborting the next read.

2004-04-25  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to [Bug 940281]. Tcl_FSJoinPath will now
	always return a valid Tcl_Obj when the input is valid.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to [Bug 931823] for a more consistent
	Tcl_FSPathSeparator() implementation which allows filesystems not to
	implement their Tcl_FSFilesystemSeparatorProc if they wish to use the
	default '/'. Also fixed associated memory leak seen with, e.g., tclvfs
	package.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: documented Tcl_FSJoinPath return values more
	clearly, and Tcl_FSFilesystemSeparatorProc requirements.

2004-04-23  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Removed my mistake from 4/19 of adding an exit
	handler to TclWinInit. TclWinEncodingsCleanup called from
	TclFinalizeFilesystem does the Tcl_FreeEncoding for us.

	* win/tclWinChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel): Case for CloseHandle
	returning zero and not throwing a
	RaiseException(EXCEPTION_INVALID_HANDLE) now being done.

2004-04-22  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c: TclSetLibraryPath's use of caching the stringrep
	of the pathPtr object to TclGetLibraryPath called from another thread
	was ineffective if the original's stringrep had been invalidated as
	what happens when it gets muted to a list.

	* win/tclWinTime.c: If the Tcl_ExitProc (StopCalibration) is called
	from the stack frame of DllMain's PROCESS_DETACH, the wait operation
	should timeout and continue.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclThread.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Provisions made so masterLock, initLock, allocLock
	and joinLock mutexes can be recovered during Tcl_Finalize.

2004-04-22  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/switch.n: Reworked the examples to be more systematically named
	and to cover some TIP#75 capabilities.

	* doc/cd.n: Documentation clarification from David Welton.

	* doc/exec.n: Added some examples, Windows ones from Arjen Markus and
	Unix ones by myself.

2004-04-21  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/Hash.3: Added note to Tcl_{First,Next}HashEntry docs that
	deleting the element they return is supported (and is in fact the only
	safe update you can do to the structure of a hashtable while an
	iteration is going over it.)

	* doc/bgerror.n: Added example from David Welton. [Patch 939473]

	* doc/after.n: Added examples from David Welton. [Patch 938820]

2004-04-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Added an exit handler in TclWinInit() so
	tclWinTCharEncoding could be freed during Tcl_Finalize().

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Added FreeEncoding(systemEncoding) in
	TclFinalizeEncodingSubsystem because its ref count was incremented in
	TclInitEncodingSubsystem.

2004-04-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/read.n: Added example from David Welton. [Patch 938056]

2004-04-19  Kevin B. Kenny   <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj) Corrected "short circuit"
	conversion of int to double. Reported by Jeff Hobbs on the Tcl'ers
	Chat.

2004-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lreplace.n, doc/lrange.n, doc/llength.n:	More examples for
	* doc/linsert.n, doc/lappend.n:			the documentation.

2004-04-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3: Corrected documentation of Tcl_FSUtime, and the
	corresponding filesystem driver Tcl_FSUtimeProc. [Bug 935838]

2004-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Added example from [Patch 936245].
	* doc/gets.n: Added example based on [Patch 935911].

2004-04-15  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclClock.c (Tcl_ClockObjCmd): Minor fault in a [clock
	clicks] error message.

2004-04-07  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): note that WIN32_CE is
	also a unicode platform.
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFindEncodings, Tcl_FindExecutable):
	* generic/tclInt.h:			    Correct handling of UTF
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath): data that is actually
	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpFindExecutable):    "clean", allowing the
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):   loading of Tcl from paths
	that contain multi-byte chars on Windows [Bug 920667]

	* win/configure:    define TCL_LIB_FLAG, TCL_BUILD_LIB_SPEC,
	* win/configure.in: TCL_LIB_SPEC, TCL_PACKAGE_PATH in tclConfig.sh.

2004-04-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	Patch 922727 committed.	 Implements three changes:

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Reworked the Tcl header files into a clean
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	hierarchy where tcl.h < tclPort.h < tclInt.h
	* win/tclWinInt.h:	and every C source file should #include
	* win/tclWinPort.h:	at most one of those files to satisfy its
	declaration needs. tclWinInt.h and tclWinPort.h also better organized
	so that tclWinPort.h includes the Windows implementation of
	cross-platform declarations, while tclWinInt.h makes declarations that
	are available on Windows only.

	* generic/tclBinary.c (TCL_NO_MATH):	Deleted the generic/tclMath.h
	* generic/tclMath.h (removed):		header file. The internal Tcl
	* macosx/Makefile (PRIVATE_HEADERS):	header, tclInt.h, has a
	* win/tcl.dsp:				#include <math.h> directly,
	and file external to Tcl needing libm should do the same.

	* win/Makefile.in (WIN_OBJS):	Deleted the win/tclWinMtherr.c file.
	* win/makefile.bc (TCLOBJS):	It's a vestige from matherr() days
	* win/makefile.vc (TCLOBJS):	gone by.
	* win/tcl.dsp:
	* win/tclWinMtherr.c (removed):

	End Patch 922727.

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-3.1):	Default encoding on Darwin
	systems is utf-8. Thanks to Steven Abner (tauvan). [Bug 928808]

2004-04-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-18.2): Added constraint because
	access(...,X_OK) is defined to be permitted to be meaningless when
	running as root, and OSX exhibits this. [Bug 929892]

2004-04-02  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: removed the macro TCL_ALIGN() from tclInt.h,
	replaced by the static macro ALIGN() in tclCompile.c [Bug 926445]

2004-04-02  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h: removed redundant #ifdef _TCLINT [Bug 928415],
	reported by tauvan.

2004-04-02  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Corrected constraint typos: "nonRoot" ->
	"notRoot". Thanks to Steven Abner (tauvan). [Bug 928353]

2004-04-01  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:  Removed obsolete tclBlockTime* declarations. [Bug
	926454]

2004-04-01  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: Fix to privately reported vfs bug with 'glob
	-type d -dir . *' across a vfs boundary. No tests for this are
	currently possible without effectively moving tclvfs into Tcl's test
	suite.

2004-03-31  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/msgcat.n:	Clarified message catalog file encodings. [Bug 811457]
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl: Updated internals to make use of [dict]s
	to store message catalog data and to use [source -encoding utf-8] to
	access catalog files. Thanks to Michael Sclenker. [Patch 875055, RFE
	811459] Corrected [mcset] to be able to successfully set a translation
	to the empty string. [mcset $loc $src {}] was incorrectly set the $loc
	translation of $src back to $src. Also changed [ConvertLocale] to
	minimally require a non-empty "language" part in the locale value. If
	not, an error raised prompts [Init] to keep looking for a valid locale
	value, or ultimately fall back on the "C" locale. [Bug 811461].
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:	Bump to msgcat 1.4.1.

2004-03-30  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclHash.c (HashStringKey): Cleaned up. This function is not
	faster, but it is a little bit clearer.
	* generic/tclLiteral.c (HashString): Applied logic from HashObjKey.
	* generic/tclObj.c (HashObjKey): Rewrote to fix fault which hashed
	every single-character object to the same hash bucket. The new code is
	shorter, simpler, clearer, and (happily) faster.

2004-03-30  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC): reverting to the previous method for
	async tests in TEBC, as the new method turned out to be too costly.
	Async tests now run every 64 instructions.

2004-03-30  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:	    New instruction code INST_START_CMD that
	* generic/tclCompile.h:	    allows checking the bytecode's validity
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	    [Bug 729692] and the interp's readyness
	* tests/interp.test (18.9): [Bug 495830] before running the command.
	* tests/proc.test (7.1):    It also changes the mechanics of the async
	* tests/rename.test (6.1):  tests in TEBC, doing it now at command
	start instead of every 16 instructions.

2004-03-30  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:  Fix to Windows glob where the pattern is a
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:	  volume relative path or a network share [Bug
	* tests/fileName.test:	  898238]. On windows 'glob' will now return
	* tests/fileSystem.test:  the results of 'glob /foo/bar' and 'glob
	\\foo\\bar' as 'C:/foo/bar', i.e. a correct absolute path (rather than
	a volume relative path).

	Note that the test suite does not test commands like
	'glob //Machine/Shared/*' (on a network share).

2004-03-30  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c:	  Fix to filename bugs recently
	* tests/fileName.test:	  introduced [Bug 918320].

2004-03-29  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main, StdinProc):	Append newline only
	* tests/basic.test (basic-46.1):		to incomplete scripts
	as part of multi-line script construction. Do not add an extra
	trailing newline to the complete script. [Bug 833150]

2004-03-28  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): corrected possible segfault
	when a compilation returns TCL_OUTLINE_COMPILE after having grown the
	compile environment [Bug 925121].

2004-03-27  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/array.n: added documentation for trace-realted behaviour of
	'array get' [Bug 449893]

2004-03-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c:	  Fix to Windows-only volume relative path
	* tests/fileSystem.test:  normalization. [Bug 923568]. Also fixed
	another volume relative bug found while testing.

2004-03-24  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NsEnsembleImplementationCmd): Fix messed up
	handling of strncmp result which just happened to work in some libc
	implementations. [Bug 922752]

2004-03-23  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/StringObj.3: Inverted the sense of the documentation of how the
	bytes parameter is documented to match behaviour. [Bug 921464]

	fix recommended by Don Porter.

2004-03-18  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: Removed TclpTime_t. It wasn't really needed,

	* doc/lsearch.n: Improved examples on the advanced capabilities of
	lsearch (with the right options, set element removal can be done)
	following discussion on tkchat.

2004-03-16  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/catch.n:	Compiled [catch] no longer fails to catch syntax
	errors. Removed the claims in the documentation that it does.
	* doc/return.n:	Updated example to use [dict merge].

2004-03-16  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure, unix/tcl.m4: add -Wno-strict-aliasing for GCC to
	suppress useless type puning warnings.

2004-03-16  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/file.n: *roff formatting fix. [Bug 917171]

2004-03-15  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinNotify.c: Fixed a mistake where the return value of
	MsgWaitForMultipleObjectsEx for "a message is in the queue" wasn't
	accurate. I removed the check on the case result==(WAIT_OBJECT_0 + 1)
	This was having the error of falling into GetMessage and waiting there
	by accident, which wasn't alertable through Tcl_AlertNotifier. I'll do
	some more study on this and try to find-out why.

2004-03-12  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#163
	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictMergeCmd):	This is based on work by Joe
	* tests/dict.test (dict-20.*):		English in Tcl [FRQ 745851]
	* doc/dict.n:				but not exactly.

2004-03-10  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclGetDate.y (TclGetDate): Fix so that [clock scan
	<timeOfDay> -gmt true] uses the GMT base date instead of the local
	one. [Bug 913513]
	* tests/clock.test: Added test cases for wrong ISO8601 week number
	[Bug 500285] and wrong GMT base date [Bug 913513]. Several tests still
	fail on Windows, and these are actual faults in [clock scan]. Fix is
	still pending.
	* generic/tclDate.c: Regenerated.

2004-03-08  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:  Fix to 'glob -path' near the root
	* tests/fileName.test:	  of the filesystem. [Bug 910525]

2004-03-08  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (TclParseInit):	Modified TclParseInit so
	* generic/tclTest.c ([testexprparser]): that Tcl_Parse initialization
	conforms to documented promised about what fields will not be
	modified by what Tcl_Parse* routines. [Bug 910595]

2004-03-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Check for define of MWMO_ALERTABLE in winuser.h.
	* win/tclWinPort.h: If MWMO_ALERTABLE is not defined in winuser.h then
	define it. This is needed for Mingw.

2004-03-05  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclTest.c: Modified TesteventObjCmd to use a
	Tcl_QueuePosition in place of an 'int' for the enumerated queue
	position, to avoid a compiler warning on SGI. [Bug 771960]

2004-03-05  Kevin B. Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/registry.test: Applied fix from [Patch 910174] to make the test
	for an English-language system include any country code, rather than
	just English-United States.1252. Thanks to Pat Thoyts for the changes.

2004-03-04  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/registry.test: Applied fixed from [Bug 766159] to skip two
	tests on Win98 that depend on a Unicode registry (NT specific).

2004-03-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (TclParseInit):	Factored the common code
	* generic/tclParse.c (TclParseInit):	for initializing a Tcl_Parse
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:		struct into one routine.

2004-03-04  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl:  Added TIP #100 support to the
	* win/tclWinReg.c:	     registry package [patch 903831]
	This provides a Windows test of the TIP #100 mechanism and a sample to
	show how unloading an extension can be done.

2004-03-04  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/dltest/pkgua.c: Fix minor syntax problems. [Bug 909288]

2004-03-03  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.5a1 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* changes: updated for 8.5a1

2004-03-03  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: default environment variable for VC++ is %MSDevDir%
	not %MSVCDir%, although vcvars32.bat sets both.

	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent) : Allows an idling notifier to
	service "Asynchronous Procedure Calls" from its wait state. Only
	useful for extension authors who decide they might want to try
	"completion routines" with WriteFileEx(), as an example. From
	experience, I recommend that "completion ports" should be used instead
	as the execution of the callbacks are more managable.

2004-03-01  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:	    update patchlevel to 8.5a1
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in, tools/tclSplash.bmp:
	* unix/configure, unix/configure.in, unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary, win/configure, win/configure.in:

	* unix/tcl.m4: update HP-11 build libs setup

2004-03-01  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS):	Allow 64-bit enabling on
	IRIX64-6.5* systems. [Bug 218561]
	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.57

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TclCheckInterpTraces):	The TIP 62
	* generic/tclTest.c (TestcmdtraceCmd):	implementation introduced a
	* tests/trace.test (trace-29.10):	bug by testing the CallFrame
	level instead of the iPtr->numLevels level when deciding what traces
	created by Tcl_Create(Obj)Trace to call. Added test to expose the
	error, and made fix. [FRQ 462580]

2004-02-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix to Tcl Bug 905163.
	* tests/fileName.test: fix to Tcl Bug 904705.

	* doc/{various}.n: removed 'the the' typos.

2004-02-26  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: fixed copyright year in Tcl.framework Info.plist

2004-02-25  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test:	Made several tests more robust to the
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:	list-quoting of path names that might contain
	* tests/exec.test:	Tcl-special chars like { or [. Should help us
	* tests/io.test:	sort out [Bug 554068]
	* tests/pid.test:
	* tests/socket.test:
	* tests/source.test:
	* tests/unixInit.test:

2004-02-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclLoad.c (Tcl_LoadObjCmd): Missing dereference caused
	segfault with non-loadable extension. [Bug 904307]

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Stop memory leak with very
	long hostnames. [Bug 888777]

2004-02-25  Pat Thoyts	<patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c: Removed some gcc warnings - except for the
	-Wconversion warning for GetGlobalAtomName. gcc is just wrong about
	this.

2004-02-24  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#100 FROM GEORGIOS PETASIS
	* generic/tclLoad.c (Tcl_UnloadObjCmd): Implementation.
	* tests/unload.test:			Test suite.
	* unix/dltest/pkgua.c:			Helper for test suite.
	* doc/unload.n:				Documentation.
	Also assorted changes (mostly small) to several other files.

2004-02-23  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/regc_locale.c (cclass): Buffer was having its size reset
	instead of being released => memleak. [Bug 902562]

2004-02-21  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclLoad.c (Tcl_LoadObjCmd): Fixed memory leak due to an
	improper error exit route.

2004-02-20  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketThreadExitHandler): Don't call
	TerminateThread when WaitForSingleObject returns a timeout.
	Tcl_Finalize called from DllMain will pause all threads. Trust that
	the thread will get the close notice at a later time if it does ever
	wake up before being cleaned up by the system anyway.

2004-02-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Changed -verbose default value to
	{body error} so that detailed information on unexpected errors in
	tests is provided by default, even after the fix for [Bug 725253]

2004-02-17  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-7.1):
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitPlatform): ensure the std fds exist to
	prevent crash condition [Bug 772288]

2004-02-17  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): Bozo mistake in memory
	releasing order when in an error case. [Bug 898910]

2004-02-16  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TclTraceExecutionObjCmd)
	(TclTraceCommandObjCmd): fix possible mem leak in trace info.

2004-02-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinInit.c (AppendEnvironment): Use the tail component of the
	passed in lib path instead of just blindly using lib+4. That worked
	when lib was "lib/..." but fails for other values. Thanks go to
	Patrick Samson for pointing this out.

2004-02-10  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/nmakehlp.c: better macro grepping logic.

2004-02-07  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/tcl.rc:
	* win/tclsh.rc: Added an 'unchecked' option to the OPTS macro so a
	core built with symbols can be linked to the non-debug enabled C
	run-time. As per discussion with Kevin Kenny. Called like this:

		nmake -af makefile.vc OPTS=unchecked,symbols

	This clarifies the meaning of the 'g' naming suffix to mean only that
	the binary requires the debug enabled C run-time. Whether the binary
	contains symbols or not is a different condition.

2004-02-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/clock.n:	Removed reference to non-existent [file ctime].

2004-02-05  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* docs/tclvars.n: Added clarification of the tcl_platform(debug) var
	that it only refers to the flavor of the C run-time, and not whether
	the core contains symbols.

2004-02-05  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (SkipToChar): Corrected CONST and type-casting
	issues that caused compiler warnings.

2004-02-04  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (StoreStatData): Removed improper refcount
	decrement of the varName parameter. This error was causing segfaults
	following test cmdAH-28.7.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Corrected references to non-existent
	$name variable in [cleanupTests]. [Bug 833637]

2004-02-03  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrected parsing of single command
	line argument (option with missing value) [Bug 833910]
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:	Bump to version 2.2.5.

2004-02-02  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Ungets): Fixes improper filling of the channel
	buffer. This is the buffer before the splice. [Bug 405995]

2004-02-01  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tests/winPipe.test: more pass-thru commandline verifications.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Special case quoting for '{'
	not required by the c-runtimes's parse_cmdline().
	* win/tclAppInit.c: Removed our custom setargv() in favor of the work
	provided by the c-runtime. [Bug 672938]

	* win/nmakehlp.c: defensive techniques to avoid static buffer
	overflows and a couple envars upsetting invokations of cl.exe and
	link.exe. [Bug 885537]

	* tests/winPipe.test: Added proof that BuildCommandLine() is not doing
	the "N backslashes followed a quote -> insert N * 2 + 1 backslashes
	then a quote" rule needed for the crt's parse_cmdline().
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Fixed BuildCommandLine() to pass the new cases.

2004-01-30  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Use the -GZ compiler switch when building for
	symbols. This is supposed to emulate the release build better to avoid
	hiding problems that only show themselves in a release build.

2004-01-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to [Bug 883143] in file normalization

2004-01-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n:
	* generic/tclFCmd.c
	* generic/tclTest.c
	* library/init.tcl
	* mac/tclMacFile.c
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix to [Bug 886352] where 'file copy -force'
	had inconsistent behaviour wrt target files with insufficient
	permissions, particular from vfs->native fs. Behaviour of '-force' is
	now always consistent (and now consistent with behaviour of 'file
	delete -force'). Added new tests and documentation and cleaned up the
	'simplefs' test filesystem.

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c
	* win/tclWinFile.c: made native filesystems more robust to C code
	which asks for mount lists.

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to [Bug 886607] removing warning/error
	with some compilers.

2004-01-28  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclObj.c (SetBooleanFromAny): Rewrite to do more efficient
	string->bool conversion.
	Many other minor whitespace/style fixes to this file too.

2004-01-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/nmakehlp.c: Use '.\nul' as the sourcefile name instead of 'nul'
	so VC 5.2 doesn't try searching the path for it and failing with a
	possible dialogbox popping up about having to add a CD to an empty
	drive. Also added a SetErrorMode() call to disable any dialogs that
	cl.exe or link.exe might create. [Bug 885537]

2004-01-22  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n: clarified documentation of 'file system' [Bug 883825]
	* tests/fCmd.test: improved test result in failure case.

2004-01-22  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test: 3 new tests
	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to [Bug 879555] in file normalization.
	* doc/filename.n: small clarification to Windows behaviour with
	filenames like '.....', 'a.....', '.....a'.

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: slight improvement to native cwd caching on
	Windows.

2004-01-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* doc/Panic.3:	Mentions of 'panic' and 'panicVA' removed from the
	documentation.

2004-01-21  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c
	* generic/tclDecls.h
	* generic/tclFCmd.c
	* generic/tclFileName.c
	* generic/tclFileSystem.h
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c
	* generic/tclInt.decls
	* generic/tclInt.h
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h
	* generic/tclPathObj.c
	* generic/tclStubInit.c
	* generic/tclTest.c
	* mac/tclMacFile.c
	* tests/fileName.test
	* tests/fileSystem.test
	* tests/winFCmd.test
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c
	* win/tclWinFile.c
	* win/tclWinInt.h

	Three main issues accomplished: (1) cleaned up variable names in the
	filesystem code so that 'pathPtr' is used throughout. (2) applied a
	round of filesystem optimisation with better handling and caching of
	relative and absolute paths, requiring fewer conversions. (3)
	clarifications to the documentation, particularly regarding the
	acceptable refCounts of objects. Some new tests added. Tcl benchmarks
	show a significant improvement over 8.4.5, and on Windows typically a
	small improvement over 8.3.5 (Unix still appears to require
	optimisation). TCL_FILESYSTEM_VERSION_2 introduced, but for internal
	use only. There should be no public incompatibilities from these
	changes. Thanks to dgp for extensive testing.

2004-01-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (Tcl_WaitPid): Fixed a thread-safety problem with
	the process list. The delayed cut operation after the wait was going
	stale by being outside the list lock. It now cuts within the lock and
	does a locked splice for when it needs to instead. [Bug 859820]

2004-01-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompile.c, generic/tclCompile.h: Two new opcodes,
	INST_LIST_INDEX_IMM and INST_LIST_RANGE_IMM, that have operand(s) of
	new type OPERAND_IDX4 which represents indexes into things like lists
	(and perhaps other things eventually.)
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Implementation of the new
	opcodes. INST_LIST_INDEX_IMM does a simple [lindex] with either front-
	or end-based simple indexing. INST_LIST_RANGE_IMM does an [lrange]
	with front- or end-based simple indexing for both the reference to the
	first and last items in the range.
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileLassignCmd): Generate bytecode for
	the [lassign] command.

2004-01-17  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: added #pragma comment(lib, "advapi32.lib") when
	compiling under VC++ so we don't need to specify it when linking.

2004-01-17  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LassignObjCmd): Add more shimmering
	protection for when the list is also one of the variables.

	BASIC IMPLEMENTATION OF TIP#57
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LassignObjCmd): Implementation of the
	[lassign] command that takes full advantage of Tcl's object API.
	* doc/lassign.n: New file documenting the command.
	* tests/cmdIL.test (cmdIL-6.*): Test suite for the command.

2004-01-15  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinReg.c: Placed the requirement for advapi.lib into the
	object file itself with #pragma comment (lib, ...) when built with
	VC++. This will simplify linking for users of the static library.

	* win/rules.vc: Added new 'fullwarn' to the CHECKS commandline macro;
	sets $(FULLWARNINGS).

	* win/makefile.vc: Removed 'advapi.lib' from $(baselibs). Added new
	logic to crank-up the warning levels for both compile and link when
	$(FULLWARNINGS) is set. Some clean-up with how the resource files are
	built and how -DTCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES is sent when compiling the
	shells.

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Small change in how TCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES is
	used.

	* win/tcl.rc:
	* win/tclsh.rc: Some clean-up with how the resource files are built.
	Fixed 'OriginalFilename' problem that still thought a debug suffix was
	still 'd', now is 'g'.

2004-01-14  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (TraceDictPath, DictExistsCmd): Adjusted
	behaviour of [dict exists] so a failure to look up a dictionary along
	the path of dicts doesn't trigger an error. This is how it was
	documented to behave previously... [Bug 871387]

	* generic/tclDictObj.c: Assorted dict fixes from Peter Spjuth relating
	to [Bug 876170].
	(SetDictFromAny): Make sure that lists retain their ordering even when
	converted to dictionaries and back.
	(TraceDictPath): Correct object reference count handling!
	(DictReplaceCmd, DictRemoveCmd): Stop object leak.
	(DictIncrCmd,DictLappendCmd,DictAppendCmd,DictSetCmd,DictUnsetCmd):
	Simpler handling of reference counts when assigning to variables.
	* tests/dict.test (dict-19.2): Memory leak stress test

2004-01-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd):  Silence compiler warnings.

	Patch 876451: restores performance of [return]. Also allows forms such
	as [return -code error $msg] to be bytecompiled.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Factored Tcl_ReturnObjCmd() into two pieces:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	TclMergeReturnOptions(), which can parse the
	options to [return], check their validity, and create the
	corresponding return options dictionary, and TclProcessReturn(), which
	takes that return options dictionary and performs the [return]
	operation.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: Rewrote TclCompileReturnCmd() to call
	TclMergeReturnOptions() at compile time so the return options
	dictionary is computed at compile time (when it is fully known). The
	dictionary is pushed on the stack along with the result, and the code
	and level values are included in the bytecode as operands. Also
	supports optimized compilation of un-[catch]ed [return]s from procs
	with default options into the INST_DONE instruction.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Rewrote INST_RETURN instruction to retrieve
	the code and level operands, pop the return options from the stack,
	and call TclProcessReturn() to perform the [return] operation.

	* generic/tclCompile.h:	New utilities include TclEmitInt4 macro
	* generic/tclCompile.c:	and TclWordKnownAtCompileTime().

	End Patch 876451.

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_GlobObjCmd): Latest changes to management
	of the interp result by Tcl_GetIndexFromObj() exposed improper interp
	result management in the [glob] command procedure. Corrected by
	adopting the Tcl_SetObjResult(Tcl_NewStringObj) pattern. This stopped
	a segfault in test filename-11.36. [Bug 877677]

2004-01-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct, Tcl_WrongNumArgs):
	Create fresh objects instead of using the one currently in the
	interpreter, which isn't guaranteed to be fresh and unshared. The cost
	for the core will be minimal because of the object cache, and this
	fixes [Bug 875395].

2004-01-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileLandOrLorExpr): cosmetic changes.

2004-01-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileLandOrLorExpr): new logic, fewer
	instructions. As a side effect, the instructions INST_LOR and
	INST_LAND are now never used.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_JUMP*): small optimisation; fix a bug in
	debug code.

2004-01-11  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (Tcl_ConditionNotify): condPtr must be dereferenced
	to see if there are waiters else uninitialized datum is manipulated.
	[Bug 849007 789338 745068]

2004-01-09  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Renamed and deprecated #defines moved to within the
	#ifndef TCL_NO_DEPRECATED block. This allows us to build Tcl to check
	for deprecated functions in use, such as panic() and Tcl_Ckalloc(). By
	request from DKF. Extensions that build with -DTCL_NO_DEPRECATED now
	have these macros as restricted.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc:	 Added -DTCL_NO_DEPRECATED usage to makefile.vc.
	Called like this:   nmake -af makefile.vc CHECKS=nodep

2004-01-09  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to infinite loop in TclFinalizeFilesystem
	[Bug 873311]
