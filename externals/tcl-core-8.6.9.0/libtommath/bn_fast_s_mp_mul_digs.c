/* LibTomMath, multiple-precision integer library -- Tom St Denis
 *
 * LibTomMath is a library that provides multiple-precision
 * integer arithmetic as well as number theoretic functionality.
 *
 * The library was designed directly after the MPI library by
 * Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with
 * additional optimizations in place.
 *
 * The library is free for all purposes without any express
 * guarantee it works.

/* Fast (comba) multiplier
 *
 * This is the fast column-array [comba] multiplier.  It is 
 * designed to compute the columns of the product first 
 * then handle the carries afterwards.  This has the effect 
 * of making the nested loops that compute the columns very
 * simple and schedulable on super-scalar processors.
 *
 * This has been modified to produce a variable number of 
 * digits of output so if say only a half-product is required 
 * you don't have to compute the upper half (a feature 
 * required for fast Barrett reduction).
 *
 * Based on Algorithm 14.12 on pp.595 of HAC.
