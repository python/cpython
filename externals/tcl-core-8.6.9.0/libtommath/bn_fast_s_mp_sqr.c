/* LibTomMath, multiple-precision integer library -- Tom St Denis
 *
 * LibTomMath is a library that provides multiple-precision
 * integer arithmetic as well as number theoretic functionality.
 *
 * The library was designed directly after the MPI library by
 * Michael Fromberger but has been written from scratch with
 * additional optimizations in place.
 *
 * The library is free for all purposes without any express
 * guarantee it works.

/* the jist of squaring...
 * you do like mult except the offset of the tmpx [one that 
 * starts closer to zero] can't equal the offset of tmpy.  
 * So basically you set up iy like before then you min it with
 * (ty-tx) so that it never happens.  You double all those 
 * you add in the inner loop

After that loop you do the squares and add them in.
