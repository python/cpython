.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure returns the current value of the \fBtk_strictMotif\fR
variable in the interpreter associated with \fItkwin\fR's application.
The value is returned as an integer that is either 0 or 1.
1 means that strict Motif compliance has been requested, so anything
that is not part of the Motif specification should be avoided.
0 means that
.QW Motif-like
is good enough, and extra features are welcome.
.PP
This procedure uses a link to the Tcl variable to provide much
faster access to the variable's value than could be had by calling
\fBTcl_GetVar\fR.
.SH KEYWORDS
Motif compliance, tk_strictMotif variable
