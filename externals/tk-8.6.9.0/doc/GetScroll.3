.SH NAME
Tk_GetScrollInfoObj, Tk_GetScrollInfo \- parse arguments for scrolling commands
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetScrollInfoObj(\fIinterp, objc, objv, dblPtr, intPtr\fB)\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_GetScrollInfo(\fIinterp, argc, argv, dblPtr, intPtr\fB)\fR
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS "Tcl_Interp" *fractionPtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter to use for error reporting.
.AP int objc in
Number of Tcl_Obj's in \fIobjv\fR array.
.AP "Tcl_Obj *const" objv[] in
Argument objects.  These represent the entire widget command, of
which the first word is typically the widget name and the second
word is typically \fBxview\fR or \fByview\fR.
.AP int argc in
Number of strings in \fIargv\fR array.
.AP "const char" *argv[] in
Argument strings.  These represent the entire widget command, of
which the first word is typically the widget name and the second
word is typically \fBxview\fR or \fByview\fR.
.AP double *fractionPtr out
Filled in with fraction from \fBmoveto\fR option, if any.
.AP int *stepsPtr out
Filled in with line or page count from \fBscroll\fR option, if any.
The value may be negative.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_GetScrollInfoObj\fR parses the arguments expected by widget
scrolling commands such as \fBxview\fR and \fByview\fR.
It receives the entire list of words that make up a widget command
and parses the words starting with \fIobjv\fR[2].
The words starting with \fIobjv\fR[2] must have one of the following forms:
.CS
\fBmoveto \fIfraction\fR
\fBscroll \fInumber\fB units\fR
\fBscroll \fInumber\fB pages\fR
.CE
.LP
Any of the \fBmoveto\fR, \fBscroll\fR, \fBunits\fR, and \fBpages\fR
keywords may be abbreviated.
If \fIobjv\fR has the \fBmoveto\fR form, \fBTK_SCROLL_MOVETO\fR
is returned as result and \fI*fractionPtr\fR is filled in with the
\fIfraction\fR argument to the command, which must be a proper real
value.
If \fIobjv\fR has the \fBscroll\fR form, \fBTK_SCROLL_UNITS\fR
or \fBTK_SCROLL_PAGES\fR is returned and \fI*stepsPtr\fR is filled
in with the \fInumber\fR value, which must be a proper integer.
If an error occurs in parsing the arguments, \fBTK_SCROLL_ERROR\fR
is returned and an error message is left in interpreter
\fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
\fBTk_GetScrollInfo\fR is identical in function to
\fBTk_GetScrollInfoObj\fR.  However, \fBTk_GetScrollInfo\fR accepts
string arguments, making it more appropriate for use with legacy
widgets.
