.SH NAME
tk_menuBar, tk_bindForTraversal \- Obsolete support for menu bars
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtk_menuBar \fIframe \fR?\fImenu menu ...\fR?
.sp
\fBtk_bindForTraversal \fIarg arg ... \fR
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures were used in Tk 3.6 and earlier releases to help
manage pulldown menus and to implement keyboard traversal of menus.
In Tk 4.0 and later releases they are no
longer needed.  Stubs for these procedures have been retained for
backward compatibility, but they have no effect.  You should remove
calls to these procedures from your code, since eventually the
procedures will go away.
.PP
From Tk 8.0 onwards, you should instead construct your menubar as a
normal \fBmenu\fR and then attach it to the \fBtoplevel\fR of your
choice using the \fB\-menu\fR option of that widget.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
