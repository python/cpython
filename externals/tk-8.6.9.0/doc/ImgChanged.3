.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
An image manager calls \fBTk_ImageChanged\fR for an image
whenever anything happens that requires the image to be redrawn.
As a result of calling \fBTk_ImageChanged\fR, any widgets using
the image are notified so that they can redisplay themselves
appropriately.
The \fIimageMaster\fR argument identifies the image, and
\fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIwidth\fR, and \fIheight\fR
specify a rectangular region within the image that needs to
be redrawn.
\fIimageWidth\fR and \fIimageHeight\fR specify the image's (new) size.
.PP
An image manager should call \fBTk_ImageChanged\fR during
its \fIcreateProc\fR to specify the image's initial size and to
force redisplay if there are existing instances for the image.
If any of the pixel values in the image should change later on,
\fBTk_ImageChanged\fR should be called again with \fIx\fR, \fIy\fR,
\fIwidth\fR, and \fIheight\fR values that cover all the pixels
that changed.
If the size of the image should change, then \fBTk_ImageChanged\fR
must be called to indicate the new size, even if no pixels
need to be redisplayed.
