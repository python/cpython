.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures manage a collection of bitmaps (one-plane pixmaps)
being used by an application.  The procedures allow bitmaps to be
re-used efficiently, thereby avoiding server overhead, and also
allow bitmaps to be named with character strings.
.PP
\fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR returns a Pixmap identifier for a bitmap
that matches the description in \fIobjPtr\fR and is suitable for use
in \fItkwin\fR.  It re-uses an existing bitmap, if possible, and
creates a new one otherwise.  \fIObjPtr\fR's value must have one
of the following forms:
.TP 20
\fB@\fIfileName\fR
\fIFileName\fR must be the name of a file containing a bitmap
description in the standard X11 format.
.TP 20
\fIname\fR
\fIName\fR must be the name of a bitmap defined previously with
a call to \fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR.  The following names are pre-defined
by Tk:
.RS
.TP 12
\fBerror\fR
The international
.QW don't
symbol:  a circle with a diagonal line across it.
.TP 12
\fBgray75\fR
75% gray: a checkerboard pattern where three out of four bits are on.
.TP 12
\fBgray50\fR
50% gray: a checkerboard pattern where every other bit is on.
.TP 12
\fBgray25\fR
25% gray: a checkerboard pattern where one out of every four bits is on.
.TP 12
\fBgray12\fR
12.5% gray: a pattern where one-eighth of the bits are on, consisting of
every fourth pixel in every other row.
.TP 12
\fBhourglass\fR
An hourglass symbol.
.TP 12
\fBinfo\fR
A large letter
.QW i .
.TP 12
\fBquesthead\fR
The silhouette of a human head, with a question mark in it.
.TP 12
\fBquestion\fR
A large question-mark.
.TP 12
\fBwarning\fR
A large exclamation point.
.PP
In addition, the following pre-defined names are available only on the
\fBMacintosh\fR platform:
.TP 12
\fBdocument\fR
A generic document.
.TP 12
\fBstationery\fR
Document stationery.
.TP 12
\fBedition\fR
The \fIedition\fR symbol.

.LP
Under normal conditions, \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR
returns an identifier for the requested bitmap.  If an error
occurs in creating the bitmap, such as when \fIobjPtr\fR refers
to a non-existent file, then \fBNone\fR is returned and an error
message is left in \fIinterp\fR's result if \fIinterp\fR is not
NULL. \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR caches information about the return
value in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up future calls to procedures
such as \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetBitmapFromObj\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetBitmap\fR is identical to \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR except
that the description of the bitmap is specified with a string instead
of an object.  This prevents \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR from caching the
return value, so \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR is less efficient than
\fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_GetBitmapFromObj\fR returns the token for an existing bitmap, given
the window and description used to create the bitmap.
\fBTk_GetBitmapFromObj\fR does not actually create the bitmap; the bitmap
must already have been created with a previous call to
\fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR or \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.  The return
value is cached in \fIobjPtr\fR, which speeds up
future calls to \fBTk_GetBitmapFromObj\fR with the same \fIobjPtr\fR
and \fItkwin\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR associates a name with
in-memory bitmap data so that the name can be used in later
calls to \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR or \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.  The \fInameId\fR
argument gives a name for the bitmap;  it must not previously
have been used in a call to \fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR.
The arguments \fIsource\fR, \fIwidth\fR, and \fIheight\fR
describe the bitmap.
\fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR normally returns \fBTCL_OK\fR; if an error occurs
(e.g. a bitmap named \fInameId\fR has already been defined) then
\fBTCL_ERROR\fR is returned and an error message is left in
interpreter \fIinterp\fR's result.
Note:  \fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR expects the memory pointed to by
\fIsource\fR to be static:  \fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR does not make
a private copy of this memory, but uses the bytes pointed to
by \fIsource\fR later in calls to \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR or
\fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.
.PP
Typically \fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR is used by \fB#include\fR-ing a
bitmap file directly into a C program and then referencing
the variables defined by the file.
For example, suppose there exists a file \fBstip.bitmap\fR,
which was created by the \fBbitmap\fR program and contains
a stipple pattern.
The following code uses \fBTk_DefineBitmap\fR to define a
new bitmap named \fBfoo\fR:
.CS
Pixmap bitmap;
#include "stip.bitmap"
Tk_DefineBitmap(interp, "foo", stip_bits,
    stip_width, stip_height);
\&...
bitmap = Tk_GetBitmap(interp, tkwin, "foo");
.CE
This code causes the bitmap file to be read
at compile-time and incorporates the bitmap information into
the program's executable image.  The same bitmap file could be
read at run-time using \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR:
.CS
Pixmap bitmap;
bitmap = Tk_GetBitmap(interp, tkwin, "@stip.bitmap");
.CE
The second form is a bit more flexible (the file could be modified
after the program has been compiled, or a different string could be
provided to read a different file), but it is a little slower and
requires the bitmap file to exist separately from the program.
.PP
Tk maintains a database of all the bitmaps that are currently in use.
Whenever possible, it will return an existing bitmap rather
than creating a new one.
When a bitmap is no longer used, Tk will release it automatically.
This approach can substantially reduce server overhead, so
\fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR should generally
be used in preference to Xlib procedures like \fBXReadBitmapFile\fR.
.PP
The bitmaps returned by \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR
are shared, so callers should never modify them.
If a bitmap must be modified dynamically, then it should be
created by calling Xlib procedures such as \fBXReadBitmapFile\fR
or \fBXCreatePixmap\fR directly.
.PP
The procedure \fBTk_NameOfBitmap\fR is roughly the inverse of
\fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.
Given an X Pixmap argument, it returns the textual description that was
passed to \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR when the bitmap was created.
\fIBitmap\fR must have been the return value from a previous
call to \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR or \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.
.PP
\fBTk_SizeOfBitmap\fR returns the dimensions of its \fIbitmap\fR
argument in the words pointed to by the \fIwidthPtr\fR and
\fIheightPtr\fR arguments.  As with \fBTk_NameOfBitmap\fR,
\fIbitmap\fR must have been created by \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR or
\fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.
.PP
When a bitmap is no longer needed, \fBTk_FreeBitmapFromObj\fR or
\fBTk_FreeBitmap\fR should be called to release it.
For \fBTk_FreeBitmapFromObj\fR the bitmap to release is specified
with the same information used to create it; for
\fBTk_FreeBitmap\fR the bitmap to release is specified
with its Pixmap token.
There should be exactly one call to \fBTk_FreeBitmapFromObj\fR
or \fBTk_FreeBitmap\fR for each call to \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR or
\fBTk_GetBitmap\fR.
.SH BUGS
.PP
In determining whether an existing bitmap can be used to satisfy
a new request, \fBTk_AllocBitmapFromObj\fR and \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR
consider only the immediate value of the string description.  For
example, when a file name is passed to \fBTk_GetBitmap\fR,
\fBTk_GetBitmap\fR will assume it is safe to re-use an existing
bitmap created from the same file name:  it will not check to
see whether the file itself has changed, or whether the current
directory has changed, thereby causing the name to refer to
a different file.
