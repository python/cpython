.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBexit \fR?\fIreturnCode\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Terminate the process, returning \fIreturnCode\fR to the
system as the exit status.
If \fIreturnCode\fR is not specified then it defaults
to 0.
.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Since non-zero exit codes are usually interpreted as error cases by
the calling process, the \fBexit\fR command is an important part of
signaling that something fatal has gone wrong. This code fragment is
useful in scripts to act as a general problem trap:
.PP
.CS
proc main {} {
    # ... put the real main code in here ...
}

if {[catch {main} msg options]} {
    puts stderr "unexpected script error: $msg"
    if {[info exists env(DEBUG)]} {
        puts stderr "---- BEGIN TRACE ----"
        puts stderr [dict get $options -errorinfo]
        puts stderr "---- END TRACE ----"
    }

    # Reserve code 1 for "expected" error exits...
    \fBexit\fR 2
}
