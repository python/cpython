.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR is invoked to record a command as an event
on the history list and then execute it using \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR
(or \fBTcl_GlobalEvalObj\fR if the \fBTCL_EVAL_GLOBAL\fR bit is set
in \fIflags\fR).
It returns a completion code such as \fBTCL_OK\fR just like \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR,
as well as a result value containing additional information
(a result value or error message)
that can be retrieved using \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR.
If you do not want the command recorded on the history list then
you should invoke \fBTcl_EvalObjEx\fR instead of \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR.
Normally \fBTcl_RecordAndEvalObj\fR is only called with top-level
commands typed by the user, since the purpose of history is to
allow the user to re-issue recently invoked commands.
If the \fIflags\fR argument contains the \fBTCL_NO_EVAL\fR bit then
the command is recorded without being evaluated.
