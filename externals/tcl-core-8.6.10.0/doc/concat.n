.SH NAME
concat \- Join lists together
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBconcat\fI \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command joins each of its arguments together with spaces after
trimming leading and trailing white-space from each of them.  If all of the
arguments are lists, this has the same effect as concatenating them
into a single list.
Arguments that are empty (after trimming) are ignored entirely.
It permits any number of arguments;
if no \fIarg\fRs are supplied, the result is an empty string.
.SH EXAMPLES
Although \fBconcat\fR will concatenate lists, flattening them in the process
(so giving the following interactive session):
.PP
.CS
\fI%\fR \fBconcat\fR a b {c d e} {f {g h}}
\fIa b c d e f {g h}\fR
.CE
.PP
it will also concatenate things that are not lists, as can be seen from this
session:
.PP
.CS
\fI%\fR \fBconcat\fR " a b {c   " d "  e} f"
\fIa b {c d e} f\fR
.CE
.PP
Note also that the concatenation does not remove spaces from the middle of
values, as can be seen here:
.PP
.CS
\fI%\fR \fBconcat\fR "a   b   c" { d e f }
\fIa   b   c d e f\fR
.CE
.PP
(i.e., there are three spaces between each of the \fBa\fR, the \fBb\fR and the
\fBc\fR).
