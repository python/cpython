.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVersion\fR should be used to query the version number
of the Tcl library at runtime.  This is useful when using a
dynamically loaded Tcl library or when writing a stubs-aware
extension.  For instance, if you write an extension that is
linked against the Tcl stubs library, it could be loaded into
a program linked to an older version of Tcl than you expected.
Use \fBTcl_GetVersion\fR to verify that fact, and possibly to
change the behavior of your extension.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetVersion\fR accepts NULL for any of the arguments. For instance if
you do not care about the \fIpatchLevel\fR of the library, pass
a NULL for the \fIpatchLevel\fR argument.

.SH KEYWORDS
