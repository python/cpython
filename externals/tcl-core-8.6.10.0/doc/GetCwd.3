.SH NAME
Tcl_GetCwd, Tcl_Chdir \- manipulate the current working directory
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
char *
\fBTcl_GetCwd\fR(\fIinterp\fR, \fIbufferPtr\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTcl_Chdir\fR(\fIpath\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_DString *bufferPtr in/out
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter in which to report an error, if any.
.AP Tcl_DString *bufferPtr in/out
This dynamic string is used to store the current working directory.
At the time of the call it should be uninitialized or free.  The
caller must eventually call \fBTcl_DStringFree\fR to free up
anything stored here.
.AP char *path in
File path in UTF\-8 format.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures may be used to manipulate the current working
directory for the application.  They provide C\-level access to
the same functionality as the Tcl \fBpwd\fR command.
.PP
\fBTcl_GetCwd\fR returns a pointer to a string specifying the current
directory, or NULL if the current directory could not be determined.
If NULL is returned, an error message is left in the \fIinterp\fR's result.
Storage for the result string is allocated in bufferPtr; the caller
must call \fBTcl_DStringFree()\fR when the result is no longer needed.
The format of the path is UTF\-8.
.PP
\fBTcl_Chdir\fR changes the applications current working directory to
the value specified in \fIpath\fR.  The format of the passed in string
must be UTF\-8.  The function returns -1 on error or 0 on success.
