.SH NAME
throw \- Generate a machine-readable error
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBthrow\fI type message\fR
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command causes the current evaluation to be unwound with an error. The
error created is described by the \fItype\fR and \fImessage\fR arguments:
\fItype\fR must contain a list of words describing the error in a form that is
machine-readable (and which will form the error-code part of the result
dictionary), and \fImessage\fR should contain text that is intended for
display to a human being.
.PP
The stack will be unwound until the error is trapped by a suitable \fBcatch\fR
or \fBtry\fR command. If it reaches the event loop without being trapped, it
will be reported through the \fBbgerror\fR mechanism. If it reaches the top
level of script evaluation in \fBtclsh\fR, it will be printed on the console
before, in the non-interactive case, causing an exit (the behavior in other
programs will depend on the details of how Tcl is embedded and used).
.PP
By convention, the words in the \fItype\fR argument should go from most
general to most specific.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
The following produces an error that is identical to that produced by
\fBexpr\fR when trying to divide a value by zero.
.PP
.CS
\fBthrow\fR {ARITH DIVZERO {divide by zero}} {divide by zero}
