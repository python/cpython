.SH NAME
Tcl_SetRecursionLimit \- set maximum allowable nesting depth in interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR(\fIinterp, depth\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter whose recursion limit is to be set.
Must be greater than zero.
.AP int depth in
New limit for nested calls to \fBTcl_Eval\fR for \fIinterp\fR.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
At any given time Tcl enforces a limit on the number of recursive
calls that may be active for \fBTcl_Eval\fR and related procedures
such as \fBTcl_GlobalEval\fR.
Any call to \fBTcl_Eval\fR that exceeds this depth is aborted with
an error.
By default the recursion limit is 1000.
.PP
\fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR may be used to change the maximum
allowable nesting depth for an interpreter.
The \fIdepth\fR argument specifies a new limit for \fIinterp\fR,
and \fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR returns the old limit.
To read out the old limit without modifying it, invoke
\fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR with \fIdepth\fR equal to 0.
.PP
The \fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR only sets the size of the Tcl
call stack:  it cannot by itself prevent stack overflows on the
C stack being used by the application.  If your machine has a
limit on the size of the C stack, you may get stack overflows
before reaching the limit set by \fBTcl_SetRecursionLimit\fR.
If this happens, see if there is a mechanism in your system for
increasing the maximum size of the C stack.
