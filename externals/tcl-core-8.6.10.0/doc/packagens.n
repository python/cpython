.SH NAME

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fB::pkg::create\fR is a utility procedure that is part of the standard Tcl
library.  It is used to create an appropriate \fBpackage ifneeded\fR
command for a given package specification.  It can be used to construct a
\fBpkgIndex.tcl\fR file for use with the \fBpackage\fR mechanism.

.SH OPTIONS
The parameters supported are:
.TP
\fB\-name \fIpackageName\fR
This parameter specifies the name of the package.  It is required.
.TP
\fB\-version \fIpackageVersion\fR
This parameter specifies the version of the package.  It is required.
.TP
\fB\-load \fIfilespec\fR
This parameter specifies a binary library that must be loaded with the
\fBload\fR command.  \fIfilespec\fR is a list with two elements.  The
first element is the name of the file to load.  The second, optional
element is a list of commands supplied by loading that file.  If the
list of procedures is empty or omitted, \fB::pkg::create\fR will
set up the library for direct loading (see \fBpkg_mkIndex\fR).  Any
number of \fB\-load\fR parameters may be specified.
.TP
\fB\-source \fIfilespec\fR
This parameter is similar to the \fB\-load\fR parameter, except that it
specifies a Tcl library that must be loaded with the
\fBsource\fR command.  Any number of \fB\-source\fR parameters may be
specified.
.PP
At least one \fB\-load\fR or \fB\-source\fR parameter must be given.
