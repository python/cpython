2005-12-30  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclStubLib.c: Corrected a typo in "missing Stubs table
	pointer."

2005-12-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tcl.decls:  Destubbed TclTomMathInitializeStubs - it is in
	* generic/tcl.h:      the stub library, not the main shared
	* generic/tclBasic.c: library. Exported Tcl_InitBignumFromDouble.
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubLib.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Regenerated.

	* generic/clock.tcl: Reverted to using the time zone abbreviation and
	not its name to "stop the bleeding" on [Bug 1386377]. This is *not* a
	good long-term solution, but there may not be one.

	* libtommath/bn_mp_sqrt.c: Improved the initial approximation to the
	square root, roughly doubling the speed of the routine. (This is a
	local change that needs to be communicated to Tom.)

	* win/Makefile.in: Corrected a bug where tommath_class.h and
	tommath_superclass.h were not installed, making it impossible for
	client code to compile against the tommath stubs.

	* library/tzdata: Updated to Olson's tzdata2005r. (Latest changes to
	Daylight Saving Time in Canada, plus redefinition of the Posix-style
	zones [e.g., EST5EDT] to be locale-independent.)

	* libtommath: Updated to Tom St.Denis's release 0.37.

2005-12-20  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (Tcl_GetMemoryInfo): Format values as longs
	and not ints, so they are less likely to wrap on 64-bit machines.

2005-12-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Modified [string is double] to use
	* tests/string.test:	TclParseNumber() to parse trailing whitespace.
	Ensures consistency, and makes it easier to cleanup after invalid
	internal reps left behind by parsing [Bugs 1360532 1382287].

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:	Added TCL_PARSE_NO_WHITESPACE to
	* generic/tclScan.c:	TclParseNumber() calls since [scan] and [expr]
	* tests/scan.test:	parsing don't want spaces in parsed numbers.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Added TCL_PARSE_NO_WHITESPACE flag to the
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	TclParseNumber() interface.

2005-12-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tcl.n: Clarify what is going on in variable substitution
	following thread on comp.lang.tcl.

2005-12-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictCmd): Ensure that we only do an
	'endCatch' when there's a preceding 'beginCatch'. [Bug 1382528] Many
	thanks to Anton Kovalenko for finding this and pointing out that it was
	a catch stack handling problem!

2005-12-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: workaround gcc warning "comparison is always
	* generic/tclTest.c:   false due to limited range of data type".

	* macosx/Tcl.xcode/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
	* unix/Makefile.in: add new tclTomMath* files.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: replace panic with Tcl_Panic.

2005-12-13  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tcl.decls:    Added changes to export an additional stubs
	* generic/tclBasic.c:   table to represent the 'libtommath' routines
	* generic/tclDecls.h:   that Tcl uses and export them to callers.
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Reran 'genstubs'
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclStubLib.c:
	* generic/tclTomMath.decls:
	* generic/tclTomMath.h:
	* generic/tclTomMathDecls.h:
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.c:
	* generic/tommath.h:
	* tools/fix_tommath_h.tcl:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:

	* generic/tclClock.c:   Made changes to silence a number of compiler
	* generic/tclIO.c:	warnings when building with mingw.
	* generic/tclIORChan.c:
	* generic/tclLink.c:
	* generic/tclListObj.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* generic/tclTimer.c:
	* win/tclWinChan.c:
	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinDde.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinReg.c:
	* win/tclWinSock.c:

2005-12-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC:DICT_FIRST,DICT_DONE): Only decrease the
	references to the dictionary once the iteration completes. Do this by
	storing the dict in the iterator context variable. [Bug 1379349] Thanks
	to Ulrich Ring and Tobias Hippler for finding this.

2005-12-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: Fix sh quoting error reported in
	bash-3.1+ [Bug 1377619] (schafer)

2005-12-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/mathfunc.n: Changed two examples from the incorrect 'tcl::math::'
	to 'tcl::mathfunc::' [Bug 1378818]

2005-12-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Define MACHINE for gcc builds. The
	lack of a definition of this variable in the manifest file was causing
	a runtime error in wish built with gcc.

2005-12-09  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* tests/lsearch.test (lsearch-10.8..10):  If the -start is off the end,
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): searching should find nothing
	at all. [Bug 1374778]

2005-12-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/Makefile.in, win/makefile.vc: Add Win x64 and CE build support
	* win/tcl.m4, win/configure:        CE still requires C code fixes.

	* generic/tcl.h: use struct __stat64 (not _stat64) for MSC_VER >= 1400
	(i.e. latest Platform SDK).

2005-12-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Cross-referenced the socket documentation better to the
	fconfigure documentation on the topic of asynch sockets.
	* doc/fconfigure.n: Added keyword to documentation of -blocking option
	so that people looking for "asynch" can find it as well.

2005-12-05  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h (Darwin): fix incorrect __DARWIN_UNIX03 configure
	overrides that were originally copied from Darwin CVS (rdar://3693001)

2005-12-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tools/tclZIC.tcl: Updated to reflect changes in calling sequence when
	GetJulianDateFromEraYearMonthDay moved to C.
	* library/tzdata: Regenerated from Olson's tzdata2005p.tar.gz - the
	'systemv' changes appear not to affect Tcl's processing of the dates.

2005-12-05  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in: move check for fts API to configure.in and run it
	* unix/tcl.m4:       on all platforms, since Linux glibc2 and *BSDs
	also have this; using fts is more efficient than a recursive
	opendir/readdir.
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TraverseUnixTree): add support to fts code for
	platforms with stat64.
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in: regen.

2005-12-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:     Use fts file API on Darwin if available.
	* unix/tcl.m4:        Addresses file delete issues in readdir noted
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: in [Bug 1034337]. (steffen)
	Remove redundant stat call for each file in DoCopyFile. (steffen)

2005-12-02  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c: Moved a tiny bit more of [clock format] from run
	* library/clock.tcl: time to compile time, and fixed a l10n bug in the
	process. [Bug 1371446]. Also, conditoned the call to SetupTimeZone to
	speed the common case where TZData($timezone) already exists, and
	achieved a puny speedup by making ::tcl::clock::getenv not throw
	errors.
	* unix/Makefile.in: Made some changes to support a 'make' command that
	is present on some antiquated versions of Solaris.

2005-12-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/clock.tcl: Continued rationalizing the code, eliminating
	numerous redundant [mc] calls. Added another time boost by precompiling
	a [::format] command to do the bulk of the work of [clock format].

2005-12-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add remaining dependency info. While automated
	maintenance of this information would be good, having it at all is much
	better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick...

2005-12-01  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclClock.c: fix warning.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): fix error when MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET unset
	* unix/configure: regen.

2005-11-30  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add dependency information relating to tclCompile.h
	since when the list of opcodes changes it is usually useful to rebuild
	everything that depends on it (but which is nonetheless a small
	fraction of the total set of Tcl source files).

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for bytecode savers/loaders. See below

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): Arrange for very simple
	[switch] invokations to be compiled into hash lookups into jump tables;
	only a very specific kind of [switch] can be safely compiled this way,
	but that happens to be the most common kind. This makes around 5-10%
	difference to the speed of execution of clock.test.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC:INST_JUMP_TABLE): New instruction to allow
	for jumps to locations looked up in a hashtable. Requires a new AuxData
	type, tclJumptableInfoType (supported by the functions DupJumptableInfo
	and FreeJumptableInfo in tclCompCmds.c) so anything that saves bytecode
	containing this *must* be updated!

2005-11-30  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c: Fixed a bad refcount in previous commit that led
	to a corrupted heap. Also silenced a warning that some compilers gave
	about the excessively long constant for JULIAN_SEC_POSIX_EPOCH. Also
	fixed a bug where [clock format] would fail in the :localtime zone for
	times before the Posix Epoch. Thanks to Miguel Sofer for pointing out
	all of these. Also rationalized the code a little bit by moving parts
	of [clock scan] into C, eliminating some code that was duplicated in
	the C and Tcl layers.

2005-11-29  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Moved a big part of [clock format] down
	* generic/tclClock.c:   to the C level in order to make it go faster.
	* generic/tclInt.h:     Preliminary measurements suggest that it
	* generic/clock.tcl:    more than doubles in speed with this change.

2005-11-29  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): Allow [lsearch -regexp] to
	process REs that contain backreferences. This expensive mode of
	operation is only used if the RE would otherwise cause a compilation
	failure. [Bug 1366683]

2005-11-28  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tools/tclZIC.tcl (convertTimeOfDay): Corrected a typo that caused
	wrong DST transitions in any time zone where the transition is
	specified as local Standard Time (as opposed to wall-clock or UTC).
	(Also updated the code to be bignum-safe.)
	* tests/clock.test (clock-51.1): Added regression test for the above.
	* library/tzdata: Updated to Olson's 'tzdata2005o' (changes for Cuba,
	Nicaragua, Jordan, and Georgia) and regenerated. Thanks to Paul
	Mackerras for reporting this problem.

2005-11-27  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): add 64bit support, check for Tiger copyfile(),
	add CFLAGS to SHLIB_LD to support passing -isysroot in env(CFLAGS) to
	configure (flag can't be present twice, so can't be in both CFLAGS and
	LDFLAGS during configure), don't use -prebind when deploying on 10.4,
	define TCL_IO_TRACK_OS_FOR_DRIVER_WITH_BAD_BLOCKING (rdar://3171542).
	(SC_ENABLE_LANGINFO, SC_TIME_HANDLER): add/fix caching, fix obsolete
	autoconf macros. Sync with tk/unix/tcl.m4.

	* unix/configure.in: fix obsolete autoconf macros, sync gratuitous
	formatting/ordering differences with tk/unix/configure.in.

	* unix/Makefile.in: add CFLAGS to tclsh/tcltest link to make executable
	linking the same as during configure (needed to avoid losing any linker
	relevant flags in CFLAGS, in particular flags that cannot be in
	LDFLAGS). Avoid concurrent linking of tclsh and compiling of
	tclTestInit.o or xtTestInit.o during parallel make.
	(checkstubs, checkdoc, checkexports): dependency and Darwin fixes
	(dist): add new macosx files.

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpDlopen): use NSADDIMAGE_OPTION_WITH_SEARCHING
	on second NSAddImage only. [Bug 1204237]
	(TclGuessPackageName): should not be MODULE_SCOPE.
	(TclpLoadMemory): ppc64 and endian (i386) fixes, add support for
	loading universal (fat) bundles from memory.

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXFCmd.c: ppc64 and endian (i386) fixes.
	(TclMacOSXCopyFileAttributes): add support for new Tiger copyfile() API
	to enable copying of xattrs & ACLs by [file copy].

	* generic/tcl.h: add Darwin specifc configure overrides for TCL_WIDE
	defines to support fat compiles of ppc and ppc64 at the same time,
	(replaces Darwin CVS fix by emoy, rdar://3693001). add/correct location
	of version numbers in macosx files.

	* generic/tclInt.h: clarify fat compile comment.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: add Darwin specifc configure overrides to support
	fat compiles, where configure runs only once for multiple architectures
	(replaces Darwin CVS fix by emoy, rdar://3693001).

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: fix #include order to support compile time
	override of HAVE_COREFOUNDATION in tclUnixPort.h when building for
	ppc64

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/default.pbxuser (new file):
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/jingham.pbxuser:
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Tcl.xcode/default.pbxuser (new file):
	* macosx/Tcl.xcode/project.pbxproj (new file):
	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/default.pbxuser (new file):
	* macosx/Tcl.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj (new file): new/updated
	projects for Xcode 2.2 on 10.4, Xcode 1.5 on 10.3 & ProjectBuilder on
	10.2, with native tcltest targets and support for universal (fat)
	compiles.

	* macosx/README: clarification/cleanup, document new Xcode projects and
	universal (fat) builds via CFLAGS (i.e. all of ppc ppc64 i386 at once).

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/aclocal.m4:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in:
	* macosx/configure.ac (new file): add support for inclusion of
	unix/configure.in by macosx/configure.ac, allows generation of a config
	headers enabled configure script in macosx (required by Xcode
	projects).

	* macosx/GNUmakefile: rename from Makefile to avoid overwriting by
	configure run in tcl/macosx, add support for reusing configure cache,
	build target fixes, remove GENERIC_FLAGS override now handled by
	tcl.m4.

	* generic/tcl.decls: add Tcl_Main declaration as comment to avoid
	'checkstubs' target complaining about it missing from stubs.

	* generic/regex.h:
	* generic/tclDate.c:
	* generic/tclEnv.c:
	* generic/tclGetDate.y:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclStubLib.c:
	* generic/tclPathObj.c:
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c:
	* generic/tclThreadStorage.c:
	* generic/tclTrace.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* generic/tommath.h:
	* tools/fix_tommath_h.tcl:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: ensure externally visible symbols not contained
	in stubs table are declared as MODULE_SCOPE (or as static if not used
	outside of own source file). These changes allow 'make checkstubs' to
	complete without error on Darwin with gcc 4.

	* generic/rege_dfa.c (getvacant):
	* generic/regexec.c (cfind):
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileSubExpr):
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespaceEnsembleCmd):
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TclUnixWaitForFile): initialise variables to
	silence gcc 4 warnings.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): fix unused variable
	warning when NO_WIDE_TYPE is defined.

	* generic/regguts.h: only #define NDEBUG if not already #defined.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c: sync whitespace & comments.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: remove declaration of obsolete&unused TclpMutex
	API.

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in: regen.

2005-11-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in (install-libraries): Updated Makefile to new
	* win/Makefile.in (install-libraries):  version of the http package.
	This fixes the ifneeded/provide mismatch reported when trying to
	require http. Should we maybe try to automatically extract the version
	number from the http code to prevent future breakage ?

	This follows the update of the version number by dgp on Nov 15 (No
	entry found in the ChangeLog).

2005-11-20  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStubLib.c: Don't set tclStubsPtr to 0 when
	Tcl_PkgRequireEx() fails [Fix for [Bug 1091431] "Tcl_InitStubs failure
	crashes wish"]

2005-11-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.5): [Bug 1047286], added a second test
	illustrating the role of "ns in callStack" in the ns's visibility
	during deletion traces.

2005-11-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n: Restored several missing lines near the %w format group
	so that %w and %W are documented with their actual behaviour. [Bug
	1359183]

2005-11-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): preserve statePtr until we
	retrieve the next statePtr from it.

2005-11-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (GetBignumFromObj): replace NULL with
	tclEmptyStringRep to stop memcpy from complaining in a debug build
	(the corresponding branch is eliminated by the optimiser otherwise).

2005-11-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): Applied Pat Thoyts' patch
	for [Bug 1359094]. This moves the retrieval of the next channel state
	to the end of the loop, as the called closeproc may close other
	channels, i.e. modify the list we are iterating, invalidating any
	pointer retrieved earlier.

2005-11-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c:	Restored the SetListFromAny routine to the
	* generic/tclObj.c:	"list" Tcl_ObjType, and restored the
	Tcl_RegisterObjType() call for "list". This addresses the needs of some
	"bridge" extensions to examine whether the Tcl_ObjType of a Tcl_Obj is
	that of the "list" Tcl_ObjType.

2005-11-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): Improved syntactic validation
	of URLs, and better error messages in some cases. [Bug 1358369]

2005-11-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/namespace.test: fix comment

2005-11-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	More data in the "can't happen" Tcl_Panic to
	aid debugging.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (CallCommandTraces): Save/restore the interp
	result during traces to fix [Bug 1355342].

2005-11-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* tests/namespace.test: fix for [Bug 1354540] and [Bug 1355942]. The
	new tests 7.3-6 and the modified 51.13 fail due to the unrelated [Bug
	1355342]

	* tests/trace.test: added tests 20.13-16 for [Bug 1355342]

2005-11-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken):
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetCommandFromObj): more partial fixes for
	[Bug 1354540] - making sure that cached references to a command being
	deleted cannot be made reusable by a delete trace.

2005-11-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_FindCommand): Do not find commands in dead
	namespaces on the path. Partial fix for [Bug 1354540].

2005-11-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Revised TclParseNumber interface to enable
	* generic/tclScan.c:	revision to the [scan] command implementation
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	to permit tests scan-4.44,55 to pass again.
	[Bug 1348067].

2005-11-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken):
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetCommandFromObj): bump the cmd epoch early
	to insure that cached references to this command are invalidated.
	Partial fix for [Bug 1352734] - at least insures that namespace-51.13
	does not cause a panic. The test is still marked as knownbug, pending
	resolution of what is actually the correct return value ([Bug
	1354540])

2005-11-09  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclTimer.c: Changed [after] so that it behaves correctly
	* tests/timer.test:   with negative arguments [Bug 1350293] and
	arguments that overflow a 32-bit word. [Bug 1350291]

2005-11-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compile.test:	Updated tests with changed behavior
	* tests/execute.test:	due to addition of bignums.
	* tests/expr-old.test:
	* tests/expr.test:
	* tests/parseExpr.test:
	* tests/platform.test:
	* tests/string.test:

2005-11-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (MAX_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD): reduce to 130
	based on errors seen on OS X 10.3 with lots of links in a dir.
	[Bug 1034337 followup]

2005-11-09  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* unix/Makefile.in (gdb-test): Added a new target to make it easier to
	run the test suite inside a debugger.

2005-11-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compExpr-old.test:	Updated tests with changed behavior due
	to addition of bignums.

	* tests/expr.test:      Portable tests expr-46.13-18 [Bug 1341368]

	* generic/tclPkg.c:	Corrected inconsistencies in the value returned
	* tests/pkg.test:	by Tcl_PkgRequire(Ex) so that the returned
	values will always agree with what is stored in the package database.
	This way repeated calls to Tcl_PkgRequire(Ex) have the same results.
	Thanks to Hemang Lavana. [Bug 1162286].

2005-11-08  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TraceVarEx): Factor out heart of Tcl_TraceVar2
	(TclTraceVariableObjCmd,TraceVarProc): Use the new internal API to
	arrange for the clientData to be cleaned up at the same time as the
	rest of the main trace record. This simplifies the code a bit at the
	same time.

2005-11-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-13.2-4): added tests to detect leak, see [Bug
	1348775]. The recently added trace-8.9 test is now 13.4.

2005-11-07  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* tests/dict.test (dict-19.2): arrange for the stress testing code to
	only stress test the dict code and not the trace code as well. [Bug
	1342858]

2005-11-05  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-8.9): added test to detect leak, see [Bug
	1348775].

2005-11-04  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:  Applied [Patch 1267871] by Matt Newman for
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:  extended error code support on Windows.
	* tests/exec.test:   Tests for extended error codes.
	* generic/tclPipe.c: Permit long codes (platform macros permitting).

2005-11-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBinary.c:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclIOCmd.c:
	* generic/tclLink.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: fix for [Bug 1334947]. The functions TclPtrSetVar,
	Tcl_ObjSetVar2 and Tcl_SetVar2Ex now always consume the newValuePtr
	argument - i.e., they will free a 0-refCount object if they failed to
	set the variable. Fixed all callers in the core.

2005-11-04  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclGetDate.y: Added abbreviations for the Korean
	* library/clock.tcl:    timezone. [Patch 1298737]
	* generic/tclDate.c:    Regenerated.

	* tools/findBadExternals.tcl: Added this script, which locates external
	symbols that do not begin with 'Tcl' or 'tcl' and hence might be in
	conflict with other link libraries. Thanks to George Peter Staplin for
	the idea and the initial version of the script. [Bug 1263012]

	* unix/Makefile.in: Trimmed a bunch of fat out of the tommath/
	directory in 'make dist'. [RFE 1333318]

	* unix/tcl.m4: Added code to enable [load] on LynxOS. Thanks to
	heidibr@users.sf.net for the patch. [Bug 1163896]. Removed the last
	vestiges of GNU dld from the Unix build [RFE 1071992].

	* unix/tclLoadDld.c: Removed.
	* unix/configure: Regenerated.

2005-11-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/trace.test: fix for [Bugs 1338280/1337229]; changed to use the
	same approach as the 8.4 patch in the ticket (i.e., removed the patch
	committed on 2005-31-10).

2005-11-03  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:   Applied [Patch 1256872] to provide unicode
	* win/tclWinConsole.c: support in the console on suitable systems.
	* win/tclWinInt.h:     Patch by Anton Kovalenko

2005-11-02  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	Applied [Patch 1096916] to support building with MSVC 8.
	* generic/regerror.c: Avoid use of reserved word.
	* generic/tcl.h:      Select the right Tcl_Stat structure
	* generic/tclDate.c:  Casts to handle 64 bit time_t case.
	* tests/env.test:     Include essential envvar on Win32
	* win/nmakehlp.c:     Handle new return codes.
	* win/makefile.vc:    Use the selected options.
	* win/rules.vc:       Check options are applicable
	* win/tclWinPort.h:   Disable deprecated function warnings
	* win/tclWinSock.c:   Provide default value to avoid warning.
	* win/tclWinTime.c:   Add casts to handle 64bit time_t type.

2005-11-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TclCheckExecutionTraces): Corrected mistaken
	assumption that all command traces are set at the script level.
	Report/fix from Jacques H. de Villiers. [Bug 1337941]

	* tests/unixNotfy.test (1.1,2):	Update error message whitespace to
	match changes in code.

	* tests/expr-old.test (expr-32.52): Use int(.) to restrict result of
	left shift to the C long range.

	* expr.test (expr-46.13): Added test that illustrates shortcoming of
	[Patch 1340260].

2005-10-31  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: fix for [Bugs 1338280/1337229]. Thanks Don.
	* tests/trace.test: fix duplicate test numbers

2005-10-31  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialSetOptionProc): Cleaned up option parsing
	to produce more informative error messages and separate error and
	non-error code paths better.
	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-8-19): Updated.

2005-10-29  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclTrace.c (TraceVarProc): [Bug 1337229], partial fix. Ensure
	that a second call with TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED does not lead to a second
	call to Tcl_EventuallyFree(). It is still true that that second call
	should not happen, so the bug is not completely fixed.
	* tests/trace.test (test-18.3-4): added tests for [Bug 1337229] and
	[Bug 1338280].

2005-10-23  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to memory leak in glob [Bug 1335006] Obj
	leak detection and patch by Eric Melbardis.

	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: where appropriate windows API is available, try to
	set 'nlink' and 'ino' stat fields (previously they were always 0). [Bug
	1325803]

2005-10-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/foreach.test (foreach-8.1): added test for [Bug 1189274]

2005-10-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_INCR_*): fixed [Bug 1334570]. Obj leak
	detection and patch by Eric Melbardis.

2005-10-21  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (RefineApproximation): Plugged a memory leak
	where two intermediate results were not freed on one return path. [Bug
	1334461]. Thanks to Eric Melbardis for the patch.

2005-10-21  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/binary.n: Clarify that virtually all code that uses the 'h'
	format in [binary scan] should be using the 'H' format instead. It is
	nearly always a bug to use the other!

2005-10-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c (TclLsetFlat):
	* tests/lset.test (lset-10.3): fixed handling of unshared lists with
	shared sublists, [Bug 1333036] reported by neuronstorm.

2005-10-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (PassReceivedError,PassReceivedErrorInterp):
	Fix crash caused by passing -1 as the length to TclNewStringObj(). Only
	Tcl_NewStringObj (the function call, not the macro) handles that sort
	of thing correctly. This makes ioCmd.test pass again.

2005-10-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclClock.c:		Removed some dead code.
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclLiteral.c:
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:
	* generic/tclScan.c:
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:

2005-10-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c: General cleanup, removing checks that are
	unnecessary due to the general contracts of other functions in the
	core, converting to using ANSI declarations, etc. Note that nearly the
	whole file has changed, but it is often just cosmetic.

2005-10-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_DICT_APPEND, INST_DICT_LAPPEND): fixed
	faulty peephole optimisation that can cause crashes, [Bug 1331475]
	reported by Aric Bills.

2005-10-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Added optimization for I32L64 systems to avoid
	using bignums to perform int multiplies. The improvement shows up most
	dramatically in tclbench's matrix.bench.

2005-10-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Restored some optimizations of the
	INST_INCR_SCALAR1_IMM opcode.

2005-10-14  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers): removed change dated
	2005-10-04 (see below). Look into [Bug 1323992] for detailed
	discussion.

	* generic/tcl.h: Fixed bad definition of CRTEXPORT which should have
	been CRTIMPORT rather. This broke compilation of generic/tclMain.c and
	was probably introduced by mistake while applying the fix for [Bug
	1256937] below.

2005-10-14  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclIncrObj, TclExecuteByteCode): Tidied up a
	couple of infelicitous do {...} while(0) constructs.

2005-10-14  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:     Fix for [Bug 1256937] - correctly decorate
	* generic/tclMain.c: imported functions from msvcrt in static builds.

2005-10-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/format.test: "Forward"-port of test updates relating to [Bug
	1284178]. The bug itself was fixed by TIP#237.

2005-10-13  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers): temporary ifdef
	TCL_THREADS changes done to de-activate pending event processing when
	channel is being closed/cutted.

2005-10-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Removed obsolete use of NO_ERRNO_H.
	* tools/man2tcl.c:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in:
	* win/configure.in:

	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.59
	* win/configure:

	* compat/tclErrno.h:	Removed obsolete file.

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (TclParseNumber): Missing goto caused crash when
	parsing "Na". [Bug 1325833]

2005-10-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (GetNumberFromObj):	Restored some lost
	optimizations for empty string values. We avoid cost of a call to
	TclParseNumber just to tell us an empty string isn't a number.

2005-10-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c (SetFsPathFromAny): TclGetString macro must not
	be combined with post-increment arguments. [Bug 1325099]

2005-10-12  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (Tcl_ExecuteByteCode, TclIncrObj): Several
	common cases inlined in hopes of gaining a little performance in [incr]

2005-10-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: New convenience macro CompileTokens().

2005-10-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Corrections to the NO_WIDE_TYPE build. Also
	added missing "break" to a switch that broke wide XOR operations.

2005-10-10  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (DeleteScriptLimitCallback)
	(SetScriptLimitCallback): Improve the interlocking between the script
	limit callback record and the hash table of current such records, to
	prevent crashes in callbacks that create callbacks.
	(Tcl_LimitSetTime): Reset the correct flag. Problem reported by
	Nicolas Castagne <castagne@imag.fr> on comp.lang.tcl

2005-10-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Fixing errors in last commit. (Two commits, the
	second removes wrong comment).

2005-10-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Initialise variables to avoid compiler
	warnings ([Bug 1320818] among others).

2005-10-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	TIP#237 IMPLEMENTATION

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Resynchronized with the HEAD; at this
	checkpoint [-rkennykb-numerics-branch-20051008], the HEAD and
	kennykb-numerics-branch contain identical code.

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]	Merge updates from HEAD

	* generic/tclExecute.c: More performance macros and special handling of
	the wide integer type for performance on 32-bit systems.

2005-10-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Macro GetNumberFromObj() is version of
	TclGetNumberFromObj() that saves a function call for common uses.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Made #undef NO_WIDE_TYPE the default on 32-bit
	systems. Being able to use 64-bit values without leaping to mp_int
	should help with performance.

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Bug fixes in the #undef NO_WIDE_TYPE
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	configuration.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Improved performance of comparison opcodes and
	bitwise operations and removed yet more dead code.

2005-10-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TraverseUnixTree): Adjust 2004-11-11 change to
	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-20.2):           account for NFS special files
	with a readdir rewind threshold. [Bug 1034337]

2005-10-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Improved performance of INST_RSHIFT and
	INST_LSHIFT.

2005-10-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Improved performance of INST_MULT, INST_DIV,
	INST_ADD, and INST_SUB and replaced a "goto... label" with a "break
	from loop" in TclIncrObj() and removed some dead code.

2005-10-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): Fixed [Bug 1109294]. Applied
	the patch provided by David Gravereaux.

	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Fixed [Bug 1104682], by application of David
	Welton's patch for it, and added a note about wideSeekProc.

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (RcClose): Removed unreachable panic/return
	statements. This fixes the remainder of [Bug 1286256].

2005-10-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/env.test (env-6.1):
	* win/tclWinPort.h: define USE_PUTENV_FOR_UNSET 1
	* generic/tclEnv.c (TclSetEnv, TclUnsetEnv): add USE_PUTENV_FOR_UNSET
	to existing USE_PUTENV define to account for various systems that have
	putenv(), but can't unset env vars with it. Note difference between
	Windows and Linux for actually unsetting the env var (use of '=').
	Correct the resizing of the environ array. We assume that we are in
	full ownership, but that's not correct.[Bug 979640]

2005-10-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]
	* generic/tclExecute.c: Updated TclIncrObj() to more efficiently add
	native long integers. Also updated IllegalExprOperandType and the
	INST_UMINUS, INST_UPLUS, INST_BITNOT, and INST_TRY_CVT_TO_NUMERIC
	sections for performance.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Updated more callers to make use of
	TclGetNumberFromObj. Removed some dead code.

2005-10-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialSetOptionProc): free argv [Bug 1067708]

	* tests/http.test:              do not URI encode -._~ according
	* library/http/http.tcl (init): to RFC3986. [Bug 1182373] (aho)

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c (TclpDlopen): use DYNAMIC_PATH on second shl_load
	only. [Bug 1204237]

	* doc/scan.n: scan %[] requires "one or more chars" [Bug 1277503]

	* tests/winFile.test (getuser): allow valid Windows usernames. [Bug
	1311285]

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseCommand): add code that recognizes {} in
	addition to {expand} for word expansion (make with
	-DALLOW_EMPTY_EXPAND).

2005-10-04  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers): now deletes any
	outstanding timer for the channel. Also, prevents events still in the
	event queue from triggering on the current channel.

	* generic/tclTimer.c (Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler): bail out early if passed
	NULL argument.

2005-10-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Re-implemented ExprRoundFunc and
	ExprEntierFunc to use TclGetNumberFromObj.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Added new routine TclGetNumberFromObj to
	* generic/tclObj.c:	provide efficient access to the actual
	internal rep of a numeric Tcl_Obj without conversions.

2005-10-03  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tools/loadICU.tcl:  Changed the file names of message catalogs to
			      lowercase.
	* tools/makeTestCases.tcl:
	* library/tzdata/*:   Olson's tzdata2005n.tar.gz. Includes new DST
	rules for USA and a number of changes to other locales.
	* tests/clock.test:   Regenerated for new US DST rules.

2005-09-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c: Separate encoding conversion of command line
	arguments from list formatting. [Bug 1306162].

2005-09-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Bug fix: Missing cast to large enough
	integral size before << operations led to broken [format %llx] results.
	Thanks to Robert Henry for reporting the bug.

2005-09-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/mathfunc.n:   implementation for TIP #255, expr min/max
	* library/init.tcl:
	* tests/info.test, tests/expr-old.test:

2005-09-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tcl.h:	Changed name of the new Tcl_Obj intrep field
	* generic/tclObj.c:	from "bignumValue" to "ptrAndLongRep" as
	* generic/tclProc.c:	described in TIP 237, and more suitable for
	other more general uses.

2005-09-27  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* tests/binary.test (binary-14.18): Added test for [Bug 1116542] though
	the bug itself was already fixed by unrelated changes.

2005-09-26  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Merge updates from HEAD.

2005-09-26  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* libtommath/:                   Updated to release 0.36.
	* generic/tommath.h:             Regenerated.
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.h: Added ten missing aliases for mp_*
	functions to avoid namespace pollution in Tcl's exported symbols. [Bug
	1263012]

2005-09-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Added -DMP_PREC=4 switch to all compiles so
	* win/Makefile.in:	that minimum memory requirements of mp_int's
	* win/makefile.vc:	will not be quite so large. [Bug 1299153].

	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	Fixed memory leak. [Bug 1299803].
	* generic/tclObj.c:

2005-09-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Revise TclIncrObj() to call
	Tcl_GetBignumAndClearObj.

	* generic/tcl.decls:	Add Tcl_GetBignumAndClearObj.
	* generic/tclObj.c:

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	make genstubs
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

2005-09-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclInt.h:		 Added TclBNInitBigNumFromWideInt() so
	* generic/tclTomMathInterface.c: that every caller isn't required to
	duplicate the sign logic to use the unsigned interface.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Reduce the number of places where Tcl intrudes
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	into the internal format details of the mp_int
	* generic/tclObj.c:	struct.
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:
	* generic/tcLStringObj.c:

	* generic/tclTomMath.h:	Added mp_cmp_d to routines from libtommath
	* unix/Makefile.in:	used by Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:

	* libtommath/bn_mp_add_d.c: Bug fix. For mp_add_d(&a, d, &c), when &a
	has the value -d, then the value &c computed should be zero, but
	mp_add_d was producing an inconsistent zero value with a sign field of
	MP_NEG, something like a value of -0, which other routines in
	libtommath can't handle.

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Dropped all creation of "bigOne" values and
	just use tommath routines that accept the value "1" directly.

2005-09-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/ParseCmd.3: copy/paste fix [Bug 1292427]

2005-09-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-09-15  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_TCL_EARLY_FLAGS): Added extra hack to allow Tcl to
	transparently open large files on RHEL 3. [Bug 1287638]

2005-09-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Bug fixes: ObjPrintfVA needed to
	support "*" fields and needed to interpret precision limits on %s
	conversions as a maximum number of bytes, not Tcl_UniChars, to take
	from the (char *) argument.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Updated several callers to use
	* generic/tclCkalloc.c: TclFormatToErrorInfo() and/or
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	TclObjPrintf().
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:

	formatting rules.

2005-09-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	First caller of TclFormatToErrorInfo.

	* generic/tclInt.h:		Using stdarg.h conventions, add more
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	fixed arguments to TclFormatObj() and
	TclObjPrintf(). Added new routine TclFormatToErrorInfo().

	* generic/tcl.h:	Explicitly standardized on the use of stdarg.h
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	conventions for functions with variable number
	* generic/tclInt.h:	of arguments. Support for varargs.h has been
	* generic/tclPanic.c:	implicitly gone for some time now. All
	* generic/tclResult.c:	TCL_VARARGS* macros purged from Tcl sources,
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	leaving only some deprecated #define's
	* tools/genStubs.tcl:	in tcl.h for the sake of older extensions.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	make genstubs

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:	Replaced all documented requirement for use of
	* doc/Eval.3:		TCL_VARARGS_START() with requirement for use of
	* doc/Panic.3:		va_start().
	* doc/SetResult.3:
	* doc/StringObj.3:

2005-09-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]	Merge updates from HEAD.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:		Added support for the "ll" width
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	specifier to [format].

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (TclAppendFormattedObjs):	Bug fix: make
	sure %ld formats force the collection of a wide value, when the value
	could be a different long.

2005-09-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIORChan.c (RcDecodeEventMask): Added missing type
	declaration for the parameter 'mask'. This fixes the [Bug 1286256]. The
	other warning can be removed only by removing the panic/return code.

2005-09-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]	Merge updates from HEAD.

2005-09-09  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:  Added two missing casts to silence messages
	from MSVC6.

2005-09-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:		New internal routine TclObjPrintf()
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	is similar to TclFormatObj() but
	accepts arguments in non-Tcl_Obj format.

	* generic/tclInt.h:		New internal routines TclFormatObj()
	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	and TclAppendFormattedObjs() to offer
	sprintf()-like means to append to Tcl_Obj. Work in progress toward
	[RFE 572392].

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	Compiler directive NEW_FORMAT when #define'd
	directs the [format] command to be implemented in terms of the new
	TclAppendFormattedObjs() routine.

2005-09-08  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	TIP#254 IMPLEMENTATION

	* generic/tclLink.c (LinkTraceProc,ObjValue): Added many new of C var
	* generic/tcl.h:			      to link to, making it
	* doc/LinkVar.3:			      easier to seamlessly
	* generic/tclTest.c (TestlinkCmd):	      couple C code and Tcl
	* tests/link.test:			      scripts in an
	application. [Patch 1242844]

2005-09-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharToUtf):	Corrected handling of negative
	* tests/utf.test (utf-1.5):	    Tcl_UniChar input value. Incorrect
	handling was producing byte sequences outside of Tcl's legal internal
	encoding. [Bug 1283976].

2005-09-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInt.h (List): Added flag to keep track of whether a list
	* generic/tclListObj.c:    with a string rep is provably canonical.
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_ConcatObj):  Do efficient concatenation and
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjEx): evaluation when the list is
	canonical, and not just when the list is pure. This should make the
	"pure list" hacking introduced in 8.3 much more robust.

2005-09-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclObj.c (pendingObjDataKey): Added missing 'static' to stop
	symbol from leaking outside the Tcl library. [Bug 1263012]

2005-09-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclScan.c:	Bug fix: The %o, %x, %i formats of [scan] must
	not accept any 0b or 0o prefixes. [scan $s %o] must continue to work
	even with KILL_OCTAL enabled.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Added TCL_PARSE_SCAN_PREFIXES to the flags
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	accepted by TclParseNumber.

2005-09-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (InitializeHostName): Synchronized use of static

	modifier in declaration and definition of function.

2005-09-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclObj.c:	TclParseNumber calls meant to parse an integer
	value now pass the TCL_PARSE_INTEGER_ONLY flag.

	* generic/tclScan.c:	Extended [scan] to accept the %lld, %llo, %llx,
	and %lli formats. Numeric scanning is now done via TclParseNumber calls

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Extended TclParseNumber to accept new flag
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	values TCL_PARSE_INTEGER_ONLY,
	TCL_PARSE_OCTAL_ONLY, and TCL_PARSE_HEXIDECIMAL_ONLY, to give caller
	more control over the parsing rules.

2005-08-31  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* windows/tclWinFile.c: clarify that Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory may be
	called with a NULL interpreter, and fix the code so this is allowed.
	Tcl's core itself (tclEncoding.c:FillEncodingFileMap()) calls this
	with a NULL interpreter.

2005-08-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Extended bignum support to include bignums so
	large they will not pack into a Tcl_Obj. When they outgrow Tcl's string
	rep length limits, a panic will result.

	* generic/tclTomMath.h:	Added mp_sqrt to routines from
	* unix/Makefile.in:	libtommath used by Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Extended sqrt(.) so that range covers the
	entire double range, accepting as many bignums in the domain as that
	will allow.

2005-08-29  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/tm.tcl (::tcl::tm::roots): Accepted Don Porter's patch for
	[Bug 1189657]. Syncs the implementation to the specification (TIP #189)

2005-08-29  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (ExprMathFunc): Restored "round away from zero"
	* tests/expr.test (expr-46.*):       behaviour to the "round" function.
	Added test cases for the behavior, including the awkward case of a
	number whose fractional part is 1/2-1/2ulp. [Bug 1275043]

2005-08-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Moved Tcl_{Cut,Splice}Channel to
	{Cut,Splice}Channel for internal use, and created new public functions
	for Tcl_{Cut,Splice}Channel which walk the whole stack of
	transformations and invoke the necessary thread actions. Added code to
	Tcl_(Un)StackChannel to properly invoke the thread actions when pushing
	and popping transformations on/from a channel.

2005-08-26  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespaceEnsembleCmd): Reset the result after
	creating an ensemble to clear any result object sharing (potentially
	caused by delete traces) so that we can safely return the name of the
	ensemble. Previously, this caused crashes in Snit's test suite.

2005-08-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclListObj.c (UpdateStringOfList): Stop uncontrolled and
	unsafe crashes from happening when working with very large string
	representations. [Bug 1267380]

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC:INST_DICT_LAPPEND): Stop dropping a
	duplicated object on the floor, which was a memory leak (and a wrong
	result too). Thanks to Andreas Kupries for reporting this.

2005-08-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Merge updates from HEAD

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Bug fix. INST_RSHIFT: shift of negative values
	produced incorrect results.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Bug fix. INST_*SHIFT opcodes stack management.
	[expr 0<<6] should be 0, not 6.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Extended the domain of round(.) to all non-Inf,
	non-NaN doubles, using bignums for the result as needed.

	* tests/binary.test (binary-65.*)         formatting floating point
	numbers with the largest and smallest possible significands, and added
	test cases for them.

2005-08-24  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Corrected some TRACE bugs that prevented
	compilation with --enable-symbols=all.
	* generic/tclStrToD.c: Revised commentary to prepare for a renaming of
	the file, removed some dead code, and fixed a bug where
	TclBignumToDouble failed on huge negative numbers.
	* tests/binary.test (binary-65.*): Added missing 'ieeeFloatingPoint'
	to large/small significand tests.
	* tests/expr.test (expr-45.*) Added missing braces around expressions.

2005-08-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Revised implementation of the ceil(.) and
	* generic/tclInt.h:	floor(.) math functions in light of the
	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	revised comparison operators, so that it is
	always true that ($x <= ceil($x)) and ($x >= floor($x)). The simple
	approach of "convert to double and call ceil() or floor()" could not
	guarantee that.

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Bug fix: TclBignumToDouble return -Inf when
	appropriate. Removed declarations of removed routines.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Revised the type promotion rules of the
	comparison operators so that they form proper equivalence classes over
	the set of numeric strings.

2005-08-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure: Regen.

	Modified Tcl_ParseNumber to accept an argument to force interpretation
	as decimal, and modified [scan] to use it. Corrected a bug where Not a
	Number with hexadecimal information bits returned consistently
	incorrect values. #ifdef-ed out some code that is needed only for IBM
	hexadecimal floating point. Fixed bugs in code to handle the corner
	cases of smallest and largest significands. Added test cases to improve
	test coverage in generic/tclStrToD.c. Added test cases for 0b notation
	(TIP #114). Removed TclStrToD, and the static functions that it calls,
	which are now dead code (TclParseNumber now does all input
	floating-point conversions.)

2005-08-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-08-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Updated OldMathFuncProc and ExprAbsFunc to do

	static for pendingObjData.

2005-08-17  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Removed a copy-and-paste accident
	that caused a (mostly harmless) double finalize of the load and
	filesystem subsystems.
	* tests/clock.test: Eliminated the bad test clock-43.1, and split
	clock-50.1 into two tests, with a more permissive check on the error
	message for an out-of-range value.

2005-08-17  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_Expr{Long,Double}{,Obj}): Updated to

	* tests/expr.test:                                  mostly).
	Added a missing "errno=0;" in ExprUnaryFunc so that spurious error
	returns aren't detected.
	Added test cases for Tcl_Expr* and Tcl_Expr*Obj because there was very
	poor test coverage in those areas.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c: Reworked parsing of numbers to call
	TclParseNumber rather than trying to do things locally.
	* generic/tclStrToD.c: Corrected a comment. Changed so that *endPtrPtr
	does not include any trailing whitespace.

2005-08-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c: New routine TclIncrObj to centralize the

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Made bit shifting opcodes and INST_MOD
	bignum-aware.

	* tests/scan.test:	Making << bignum-aware means that repeated
	* tests/string.test:	left shifting cannot turn a positive into a
	negative. Revised [int_range] and [largest_int] utility commands in the
	test suite that relied on that happening. Without revision they became
	infinite loops.

	* generic/tclTomMath.h:	Added mp_and, mp_expt_d, and mp_neg to
	* unix/Makefile.in:	routines from libtommath used by Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:

2005-08-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Extended Bignum auto-narrowing to auto-narrow
	to tclWideIntType when appropriate; this helps keep things working as
	the bytecode execution code is migrated to supporting bignums.

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Major overhaul of IllegalExprOperandType.
	Changed several TclNewFooObj() calls to more logically appropriate
	ones. Added several TODO comments marking opportunies for future work.
	Made more use of the eePtr->constants. Made INST_UMINUS bignum aware.

2005-08-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Simplify doCondJump. Use eePtr->constants as
	result of INST_DICT_NEXT, INST_LAND, and INST_LOR. Separate INST_LNOT
	from INST_UMINUS and simplify.

2005-08-12  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c (MktimeObjCmd):
	* library/clock.tcl (GetSystemTimeZone, LoadZoneinfoFile)
	(ReadZoneinfoFile):
	* tests/clock.test (clock-50.1):
	Added functionality to read /etc/localtime if it exists, so that Tcl's
	time can track system time on Linux even if TZ is not set. Changed
	::tcl::clock::Mktime to check for failure, and added a test case that
	mimics failure but is really success.

2005-08-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Rewrite of INST_LAND/INST_LOR to take advantage
	of loss of "pure double" issues. Merged INST_UPLUS with
	INST_TRY_CVT_TO_NUMERIC and updated to use improved rules for impure
	"double"s as well.

	* generic/tclStrToD.c:	Restored conditional generation of
	tclWideIntType values by TclParseNumber so that Tcl's not completely
	broken while bignum calculation support is incomplete. The NO_WIDE_TYPE
	macro can be used to disable this.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (ExprAbsFunc): First pass making [expr abs(.)]
	bignum-aware.

2005-08-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c:         Eliminated the USE_THREAD_STORAGE option
	* generic/tclInt.h:           (which is on in every build generated by
	* generic/tclThread.c:        by the standard configurator).
	* generic/tclThreadStorage.c: Eliminated the code for thread specific
	* unix/configure:             data without USE_THREAD_STORAGE and
	* unix/tcl.m4:                radically refactored the code for
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in:        USE_THREAD_STORAGE so that it has fewer
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:         dependencies on the order of
	* win/configure:              finalization. (Also, made 'make
	* win/Makefile.in:            distclean' on Windows clean just a little
	* win/rules.vc:               bit cleaner.)
	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:

2005-08-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclTomMath.h:	Added mp_shrink, mp_to_unsigned_bin,
	* unix/Makefile.in:	mp_to_unsigned_bin_n, and mp_unsigned_bin_size
	* win/Makefile.in:	to routines from libtommath used by Tcl.
	* win/makefile.vc:

	* generic/tommath.h:	make gentommath_h

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Substantial rewrite to make all number parsing
	flow through TclParseNumber(). Also established the NO_WIDE_TYPE and
	BIGNUM_AUTO_NARROW #ifdef's to help track the assumptions of different
	portions of the code.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Added NO_WIDE_TYPE #ifdefs

2005-08-10  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Pushed Tcl_FinalizeLoad and
	Tcl_ResetFilesystem down after Tcl_FinalizeThreadAlloc because we can't
	unload DLL's until after their TSD keys are finalized. (Note that we'll
	still see aborts if an unloaded DLL has TSD - that still needs to be
	fixed.

	* tests/compExpr-old.test (compExpr-3.8): Made tests conditional on
	* tests/expr.test (expr-3.8):             'unix' because they get
	stack overflows on Win32 threaded builds,

2005-08-09  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: fix to [file rootname] bug in optimized code
	path reported on comp.lang.tcl.

2005-08-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Replaced some goto's with loops and started
	use of BIGNUM_AUTO_NARROW and NO_WIDE_TYPE.

2005-08-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclThreadStorage.c: Stop exposing the guts of the thread
	storage system through the internal stubs table. Client code should
	always use the standard API.

2005-08-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]
	* generic/tclObj.c:	Rewrote Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj().

2005-08-05  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (localeTable): Solaris uses a non-standard name
	for the cp1251 charset. Thanks to Victor Wagner for reporting this.
	[Bug 1252475]

2005-08-05  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: Removed unused file ldAout.tcl.
	* win/makefile.bc: [Bug 1244361]

	* tests/binary.test: Cleaned up testing for scanning of NaN. [Bug
	1246264]

	* generic/tclBasic.c (ExprAbsFunc): Added code to handle the corner
	* tests/expr.test (expr-38.1):      case of applying 'abs' to the
	smallest 32-bit integer. [Bug 1241572]

2005-08-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CloseChannel): Fixed comment nit, added apparently
	missing word to complete a sentence.

	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_DbDecrRefCount): Fixed whitespace nit in panic
	message.

2005-08-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Updated from HEAD

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Rewrote Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj() and supporting
	routines to make use of TclParseNumber. This reduces the potential
	number of times a string value must be scanned.

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Simplified routines that manage the typeTable.
	Deleted the UpdateStringOfBoolean() routine, that can never be called.

2005-08-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:	Untangled some dependencies in the
	* generic/tclEvent.c:		order of finalization routines.
	* generic/tclInt.h:		[Bug 1251399]
	* generic/tclObj.c:

2005-08-02  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Updated from HEAD

2005-07-30  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpDlopen, TclpLoadMemory): workarounds for
	bugs/changes in behaviour in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger.

2005-07-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoGlobalsCmd): Even in high-speed mode, still
	have to take care with non-existant variables. [Bug 1247135]

2005-07-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update link to msys_mingw8.zip.

2005-07-28  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compExpr-old.test:	Still more conversion of "nonPortable"
	* tests/error.test:		tests into tests with constraints that
	* tests/expr-old.test:		describe the limits of their
	* tests/expr.test:		portability. Also more consolidation
	* tests/fileName.test:		of constraint synonyms.
	* tests/format.test:		wideis64bit, 64bitInts => wideIs64bit
	* tests/get.test:		wideIntegerUnparsed => wideIs32bit
	* tests/load.test:		wideIntExpressions => wideBiggerThanInt
	* tests/obj.test:
	* tests/parseExpr.test:		Dropped "roundOffBug" constraint that
	* tests/string.test:		protected from buggy sprintf.

2005-07-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): Arrange for POSIX systems to
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpOpenFile):	 use the O_APPEND flag for
	* tests/exec.test (exec-19.1):		 files opened in a pipeline
	like ">>this". Note that Windows cannot support such access; there is
	no equivalent flag on the handle that can be set at the kernel-call
	level. The test is unix-specific in every way. [Bug 1245953]

2005-07-27  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c:	Converted the $::tcl_precision value to be kept
	per-thread to prevent different threads from stomping on each others'
	formatting prescriptions.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** Multi-threaded programs that set the
	value of ::tcl_precision will now have to set it in each thread.

	* tests/expr.test:	Consolidated equivalent constraints into
	* tests/fileName.test:	single definitions and (more precise) names:
	* tests/get.test:	longis32bit, 32bit, !intsAre64bit => longIs32bit
	* tests/listObj.test:	empty => emptyTest; winOnly => win
	* tests/obj.test:	intsAre64bit => longIs64bit
	Also updated some "nonPortable" tests to use constraints that mark
	precisely what about them isn't portable, so the tests can run where
	they work.

	* library/init.tcl ([unknown]): Corrected return code handling in the
	portions of [unknown] that expand incomplete commands during
	interactive operations. [Bug 1214462].

2005-07-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Check for a $prefix/share directory and add it the
	the package if found. This will check for Tcl packages in
	/usr/local/share when Tcl is configured with the default dist install.
	[Patch 1231015]

2005-07-26  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CallWhenDeleted):	Converted to use
	per-thread counter, rather than a process global one that required
	mutex protection. [RFE 1077194]

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclTeardownNamespace):	Re-ordering so that
	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.4):	command delete traces fire
	while the command still exists. [Bug 1047286]

2005-07-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PROG_TCLSH, SC_BUILD_TCLSH):
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_PROG_TCLSH, SC_BUILD_TCLSH): Split confused search
	for tclsh on PATH and build and install locations into two macros.
	SC_PROG_TCLSH searches just the PATH. SC_BUILD_TCLSH determines the
	name of the tclsh executable in the Tcl build directory. [Bug 1160114]
	[Patch 1244153]

2005-07-23  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl:	Updates to the Tcl script library to make use
	* library/history.tcl:	of Tcl 8.4 features. Forward port of
	* library/init.tcl:	appropriate portions of [Patch 1237755].
	* library/package.tcl:
	* library/safe.tcl:
	* library/word.tcl:

2005-07-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/string.test: Add string is tests for functionality that was not
	tested.
	* win/README: Update msys + mingw URL. Remove old Cygwin + mingw info.

2005-07-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_DICT_*): stop 2 compiler warnings for
	uninitialised variables.

2005-07-23  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC:INST_DICT_INCR_IMM): Fix the incrementor
	to work correctly with wide values.

2005-07-21  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileDictCmd): First run at a compiler
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): for dictionaries. Also
	added an instruction to support 'finally'-like clauses, exposed more of
	the dict guts to the rest of the core, and defined a few tests to
	exercise more obscure parts of the compiler's operation that were bugs
	during development.

2005-07-21  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/ldAout.tcl (***REMOVED***):	Removed support for ancient
	* unix/configure:			BSD's, IRIX 4, RISCos and
	* unix/Makefile.in:			Ultrix. Removed two files whose
	* unix/tcl.m4:				code is used only on those
	* unix/tclLoadAout.c (***REMOVED***):	antique platforms.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** if anyone actually uses those
	platforms; it is to be noted though, that an error in the installer has
	actually not caused a necessary file to be installed on those platforms
	in several releases, and nobody's complained.

2005-07-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (RefineResult):  Plugged a stupid memory leak in
	RefineResult (called from Tcl_StrToD). [Tk Bug 1227781]

2005-07-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c (TclClockLocaltimeObjCmd,ThreadSafeLocalTime):
	* library/clock.tcl (GuessWindowsTimeZone, ClearCaches):
	* tests/clock.test (clock-49.1, clock-49.2):
	Handle correctly the case where localtime() returns NULL to report a
	conversion error. Also handle the case where the Windows registry
	contains timezone values that can be mapped to a tzdata file name but
	the corresponding file does not exist or is corrupted, by falling back
	on a Posix timezone string instead; this last case will avoid calls to
	localtime() in starpacks on Windows. [Bug 1237907]

2005-07-14  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: Update to follow style guidelines.
	(TclPrintInstruction): Reorganize to do better printing out of bytecode
	with far fewer "special hacks" for particular opcodes.
	* generic/tclCompile.h: Requires two new opcode types.

2005-07-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c:	Use a ProcessGlobalValue to store the value
	* win/tclWinSock.c:	returned by Tcl_GetHostName() ([info
	hostname]). Also re-order initialization of the value on Windows to
	favor GetComputerName() over gethostname() as a source of the
	information.

2005-07-12  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Updated from HEAD

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj, SetDoubleFromAny)
	(Tcl_GetIntFromObj, SetIntOrWideFromAny):
	* generic/tclStrToD.c (TclParseNumber, etc.):
	* tclTomMathInterface.c (TclBNInitBignumFromWideUInt):
	* tests/obj.test (obj-1.1, obj-2.2, obj-3.1, obj-3.2):

	Initial attempt at an implementation of TIP #249, comprising a unified
	parser and modifications to the Tcl_Get*FromObj routines to use it.
	Further integration of the parser is necessary and planned.

2005-07-12  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/lsearch.n: Clarify documentation of -exact option; wording was
	open to misinterpretation by non-English speakers.

2005-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: General style cleanup.

2005-07-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Reimplement long and wide
	type integer division and modulus operations so that the smallest and
	largest integer values are handled properly. The divide operation is
	more efficient since it no longer does a modulus or negation and only
	checks for a remainder when the quotient will be a negative number.
	The modulus operation is now a bit more complex because of a number of
	special cases dealing with the smallest and largest integers.
	* tests/expr.test: Add test cases for division and modulus operations
	on the smallest and largest integer values for 32 and 64 bit types.
	[Patch 1230205]

2005-07-06  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclLink.c:	Simplified LinkTraceProc [Bug 1208108].

2005-07-05  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Purged use of TCLTESTARGS [RFE 1161550].

	* generic/tclUtil.c:	Converted TclFormatInt() into a macro.
	* generic/tclInt.decls:	[RFE 1194015]
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:	make genstubs
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	Allow for [namespace import] of a command
	* tests/namespace.test:	over a previous [namespace import] of itself
	without throwing an error. [RFE 1230597]

2005-07-04  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDictObj.c (DictForCmd, DictFilterCmd): Interlocking of
	dictionary internal representations is now done in the core of the dict
	iterator. Purge the last attempts at doing it at a higher level as they
	didn't work and were no longer needed.

2005-07-01  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: protect against spurious wake-ups while waiting
	on the condition variable when tearing down the notifier thread [Bug
	1222872].

2005-06-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): When parsing an integer
	operand for a unary minus expression operator, check for a wide integer
	that is actually LONG_MIN. If found, convert back to a long int type.
	* tests/expr.test: Add constraint for 32bit long int type and 64bit
	wide int type. Add tests that parse the smallest/largest long int and
	wide int values.

2005-06-24  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclPreserve.c (TclFinalizePreserve): Changed the finalization
	logic so that Tcl_Preserve finalizes after exit handlers run; a lot of
	code called from Tk's exit handlers presumes that Tcl_Preserve will
	still work even from an exit handler.

2005-06-24  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl:	Make file safe to re-[source] without
	destroying registered auto_mkindex_parser hooks.

2005-06-23  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: More rewriting of __asm__ blocks that implement
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: SEH in GCC, because mingw's gcc 3.4.2 is not as
	forgiving of violations committed by the old code and caused panics.
	[Bug 1225957]

2005-06-23  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: fixed useversion glob pattern to accept
	multi-digit patchlevels.

2005-06-22  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: Potential buffer overflow. [Bug 1225571] Thanks to
	Pat Thoyts for discovery and fix.

2005-06-22  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclInt.h:			    Changed the finalization
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize):	    logic to defer the
	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): shutdown of the pipe
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclFinalizePipes):    management until after all
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclFinalizePipes):	    channels have been closed,
	in order to avoid a situation where the Windows PipeCloseProc2 would
	re-establish the exit handler after exit handlers had already run,
	corrupting the heap. [Bug 1225727] Also corrected a potential read of
	uninitialized memory in PipeClose2Proc [Bug 1225044]

2005-06-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Followup to change made on 2005-06-18 by Daniel
	Steffen. There are compilers (*) who error out on the redefinition of
	WORDS_BIGENDIAN. We have to undef the previous definition (on the
	command line) first to make this acceptable. (*): AIX native.

2005-06-21  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: Changed [file split] and [file join] to treat
	Windows drive letters similarly to ~ syntax and make sure that they
	appear with "./" in front when they are in intermediate components of
	the path. [Bug 1194458]
	* tests/fileName.test: Added test for the above bug.

2005-06-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Added missing walk of the list of active
	* generic/tclTrace.c:	traces to cleanup references to traces being
	* generic/tclInt.h:	deleted. [Bug 1201035] Made the walk of the
	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.*): active trace list aware of the
	direction of trace scanning, so the proper correction can be made.
	[Bug 1224585]

2005-06-21  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS): Only enable the 'compile' special
	debugging feature when requested in configure.in; removes irrelevant
	junk from the configure files of extensions that use Tcl's tcl.m4.

2005-06-20  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h (INST_PUSH_RETURN_OPTIONS): New opcode to allow
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileCatchCmd):	   compilation of
	* generic/tclCompile.c:				   TIP#90 catch [Bug
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):	   1219112]

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileSwitchCmd): Ensure we spill to the
	command form in all cases where it generates an error.

2005-06-20  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd): Generate an error if a mode
	argument like -exact is passed more than once to the switch command.
	The previous implementation silently accepted invalid switch
	invocations like [switch -exact -glob $str ...].
	* tests/for.test: Check some error cases when invoking continue and
	break inside a for loop next script.
	* tests/switch.test: Add checks for shortened version of a mode
	argument like -exact. Add test for more than one mode argument. Add
	test for odd case of passing a variable as a body script.

2005-06-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: ensure WORDS_BIGENDIAN is defined correctly with
	fat compiles on Darwin (i.e. ppc and i386 at the same time), the
	configure AC_C_BIGENDIAN check is not sufficient in this case because a
	single run of the compiler builds for two architectures with different
	endianness.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): add -headerpad_max_install_names to LDFLAGS to
	ensure we can always relocate binaries with install_name_tool.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59

2005-06-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Fix for [Bug 1154163]; only

	creation when traces trigger in situations where the command has
	already been deleted.

	* generic/tclResult.c:	when a command procedure simply does a
	* generic/tclTest.c:	"return TCL_RETURN;" we must interpret that
	* tests/result.test:	the same as
	"return Tcl_SetReturnOptions(interp, Tcl_NewObj());"  [Bug 1209759].

2005-06-01  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/configure.in, unix/tcl.m4: Standardize generation of help
	messages to always use AC_HELP_STRING and always (except for --with-tcl
	and --with-tk, where the default is complex) say what the default is.

2005-05-31  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: the notifier thread is now created as joinable
	thread and it is properly joined in Tcl_FinalizeNotifier. This is an
	attempt to fix the [Bug 1082283].

2005-05-30  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Fixed [Bug 1204064]

	* unix/configure.in: corrected framework finalization to softlink stub
	library to Versions/8.x subdir instead of Versions/Current.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59

2005-05-25  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): add necessary cast

2005-05-25  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	TIP#182 IMPLEMENTATION	[Patch 1165062]

2005-05-24  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl:	Updated [unknown] to be sure the [return]

2005-05-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/env.test: added DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH to the list of env vars
	that need to be handled specially.

	* macosx/Makefile:
	* macosx/README:
	* macosx/Tcl-Info.plist.in (new file):
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: moved all Darwin framework build support from
	macosx/Makefile into the standard unix configure/make buildsystem, the
	macosx/Makefile is no longer required to build Tcl.framework (but its
	functionality is still available for backwards compatibility).
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclLoadFile):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: added support for [load]ing .bundle binaries in
	addition to .dylib's: .bundle's can be [unload]ed (unlike .dylib's),
	and can be [load]ed from memory, e.g. directly from VFS without needing
	to be written out to a temporary location first. [Bug 1202209]
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in: autoheader-2.59

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): change [time] called with a
	count > 1 to return a string with a float value instead of a rounded
	off integer. [Bug 1202178]

	* doc/expr.n:
	* doc/string.n: fixed roff syntax complaints from 'make html'.

2005-05-20  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:	Corrected parser to recognize all
	boolean literals accepted by Tcl_GetBoolean, including prefixes like
	"y" and "f", and to allow "eq" and "ne" as function names in the proper
	context. [Bug 1201589].

2005-05-19  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjvInternal): Rewrite for greater
	clarity; although 'goto' is Bad, the contortions you have to go through
	to avoid it can be worse...

2005-05-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (Tcl_InitNotifier): fixed crashing CFRelease
	of runLoopSource in Tcl_InitNotifier (reported by Zoran):
	CFRunLoopAddSource doesn't CFRetain, so can only CFRelease the
	runLoopSource in Tcl_FinalizeNotifier.

2005-05-18  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_ExprBoolean):	Rewrite as wrapper around
	Tcl_ExprBooleanObj.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c ([string is boolean/true/false]): Rewrite dropping
	string-based Tcl_GetBoolean call, so that internal reps are kept for
	subsequent quick boolean operations.

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Dropped most special handling of the "boolean"
	Tcl_ObjType, since that type should now be rarely encountered.

	* doc/BoolObj.3:	Rewrite of documentation dropping many details
	about the internals of Tcl_Objs. Shorter documentation focuses on the
	function and use of the routines.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Revision to the "boolean" Tcl_ObjType, so that
	* generic/tclObj.c:	only string values like "yes" and "false" are
	* tests/obj.test:	kept as the "boolean" Tcl_ObjType. The string
	values "0" and "1" are kept as "int" Tcl_ObjType, which also produce
	quick calls to Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj(). Since this internal change
	means a Tcl_ConvertToType to a "boolean" Tcl_ObjType might not produce
	a Tcl_Obj of type "boolean", the registration of the "boolean" type is
	also removed.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	For callers of Tcl_GetObjType on the type name "boolean".

2005-05-17  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclInitObjSubsystem):	Removed the
	* tests/listObj.test:	registration of the Tcl_ObjType's "list",
	* tests/obj.test:	"procbody", "index", "ensembleCommand",
	"localVarName", and "levelReference". The only reason to register a
	Tcl_ObjType is to have it returned by Tcl_GetObjType, and the only
	reason for that is to retrieve a (Tcl_ObjType *) to pass to
	Tcl_ConvertToType(). None of the types above can support a
	Tcl_ConvertToType() call; they panic. Better not to offer something
	than to lead users into a panic.
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	For callers of Tcl_GetObjType on the type names listed above.

2005-05-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: conditioned definition of EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION
	structures on HAVE_NO_SEH, to fix a bug in buildability on MSVC.

2005-05-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: fixed link error due to direct access by tclTest.c
	to the MODULE_SCOPE tclPlatform global: renamed existing
	TclWinGetPlatform() accessor to TclGetPlatform() and moved it to
	generic code so that it can be used by on all platforms where
	MODULE_SCOPE is enforced.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): made use of CoreFoundation API configurable and
	added test of CoreFoundation availablility to allow building on ppc64,
	replaced HAVE_CFBUNDLE by HAVE_COREFOUNDATION; test for availability of
	Tiger or later OSSpinLockLock API.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (new file): when CoreFoundation is
	available, use new CFRunLoop based notifier: allows easy integration
	with other event loops on Mac OS X, in particular the TkAqua Carbon
	event loop is now integrated via a standard tcl event source (instead
	of TkAqua upon loading having to finalize the exsting notifier and
	replace it with its custom version). [Patch 1202052]

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: don't run unthreaded tests on Darwin since
	notifier may be using threads even in unthreaded core.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): test for thread-unsafe realpath during
	configure, as Darwin 7 and later realpath is threadsafe.

	* macosx/Makefile: enable configure caching.

	* unix/configure.in: wrap tclConfig.h header in #ifndef _TCLCONFIG so
	that it can be included more than once without warnings from gcc4.0 (as
	happens e.g. when including both tclInt.h and tclPort.h)

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c:
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: fixed gcc 4.0 warnings.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59
	* unix/tclConfig.h.in: autoheader-2.59

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: make genstubs

2005-05-13  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Further rework of the SEH logic. All
	EXCEPTION_REGISTRATION records are now in the activation record rather
	than pushed on the stack.

2005-05-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Dropped the TCL_NO_MATH configuration. It's
	* generic/tclBinary.c:	believed this has not been working in a long
	* generic/tclExecute.c: time. Tcl needs math.h. [RFE 1200680]
	* unix/Makefile.in:

2005-05-12  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/mathfunc.n: Changed NAME line to match the name of the page.

2005-05-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch] Resynchronized with the HEAD; at this
	checkpoint [-rkennykb-numerics-branch-20050511], the HEAD and
	kennykb-numerics-branch contain identical code.

2005-05-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (TclStrToD, RefineResult, ParseNaN): Changed the
	code to cast 'char' to UCHAR explicitly when using ctype macros, to
	silence complaints from the Solaris compiler.

2005-05-10  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: add lint attr to enum to satisfy strictly
	compliant compilers that don't like trailing ,s.

	* tests/string.test: string-10.[21-30]
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): add extra checks to prevent
	possible UMR in unichar cmp function for string map.

2005-05-10  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (FormatNumber): Fixed a bug where NaN's resulted
	in reads of uninitialized memory when using 'd', 'q', or 'Q' format.
	* generic/tclStrToD.c (ParseNaN, TclFormatNaN): Added code to handle
	the peculiarities of HP's PA_RISC, which uses a different 'quiet' bit
	in NaN from everyone else.
	* libtommath/tommath_superclass.h: Corrected C++-style comment.

2005-05-10  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	Merged all changes on kennykb-numerics-branch back into the HEAD.

	[Bug 1198892]

2005-05-09  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace, TclWinCPUID): Reworked
	structured event handling to function even with -fomit-frame-pointers.

2005-05-08  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]
	* generic/tclStrToD.c: Made code more portable by finding a workaround
	for MSVC's 'volatile' issue that does not require conditional
	compilation.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclWinCPUID): Removed structured event handling
	from the GCC code since (a) bad code is generated by the instruction
	scheduling with -O2, and (b) it's not needed on any reasonably modern
	CPU.

2005-05-07  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]
	* generic/tclEvent.c:  Moved initialization of tclStrToD.c's
	* generic/tclInt.h:    static constants into a procedure called
	* generic/tclStrToD.c: from TclInitSubsystems to avoid double checked
	locking protocol. Cleaned up an issue where MSVC ignored the
	'volatile' specifier, causing incorrect comparison of an underflowed
	number against zero.

2005-05-06  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: correct Solaris 10 (5.10) check and add

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:	search can be done more efficiently when it is
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:recognized that a pattern match is really an
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	exact match. [Patch 1076088]
	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:	Factored common efficiency trick into a
	macro named CompileWord.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:	Replaced all instance of
	* generic/tclCompile.c:		TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE with TCL_ERROR.
	* generic/tclInt.h:		Now that we've eradicated the mistaken
	* tests/appendComp.test:	notion of a "compile-time error", we
	can use the TCL_ERROR return code to signal any failure to produce
	bytecode.

	overflow/underflow behaviour that the merge of 2004-04-25 messed up.
	Thanks to Don Porter for calling attention to this bug. Also removed an
	uninitialised memory reference in this function that valgrind caught.
	Also changed to return TCL_ERROR on a pure NaN.

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (RefineResult): Added a test for the initial
	approximation being HUGE_VAL; this test avoids EDOM being returned from
	ldexp on some platforms on input values exceeding the floating point
	range.

	* tests/expr.test (expr-29.*, expr-30.*): Added further tests of
	overflow/underflow on input conversions.

2005-04-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* compat/string.h: fixed memchr() protoype for __APPLE__ so that we
	build on Mac OS X 10.1 again.

	* generic/tclNotify.c (TclFinalizeNotifier): fixed notifier not being
	finalized in unthreaded core (was testing for notifier initialization
	in current thread by checking thread id != 0 but thread id is always 0
	in untreaded core).

	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent):
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): don't call ScaleTimeProc for
	zero wait times (as specified in TIP 233).

	* unix/Makefile.in: added @PLAT_SRCS@ to SRCS and split out NOTIFY_SRCS
	from UNIX_SRCS for parity with UNIX_OBJS & NOTIFY_OBJS.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): added configure checks for recently added
	linker flags -single_module and -search_paths_first to allow building
	with older tools (and on Mac OS X 10.1), use -single_module in SHLIB_LD
	and not just T{CL,K}_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS, added unexporting from Tk of
	symbols from libtclstub to avoid duplicate symbol warnings, added
	PLAT_SRCS definition for Mac OS X, defined MODULE_SCOPE to
	__private_extern__.

2005-04-22  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	The 2005-04-21 changes to Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj were done to bring it
	into agreement with its docs. Further investigation reveals it was the
	docs that were incorrect.

	* doc/BoolObj.3:	Corrections to the documentation of
	Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj to bring it into agreement with what this public
	interface has always done, including noting the difference in function
	between Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj and Tcl_GetBoolean.

	* generic/tclGet.c:	Revised Tcl_GetBoolean to no longer be a
	wrapper around Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj (different function!).

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Removed TclGetTruthValueFromObj routine that
	was added yesterday. Revisions so that only Tcl_GetBoolean-approved
	values get the "boolean" Tcl_ObjType. This retains the fix for [Bug
	1187123].
	* tests/string.test:	Test string-23.0 for Bug 1187123.

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Revert most recent change.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:

2005-04-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/GetInt.3:	Convert argument "string" to "str" to agree with code.
	Also clarified a few details on int and double formats.
	* generic/tclGet.c:	Radical code simplification. Converted
	Tcl_GetFoo() routines into wrappers around Tcl_GetFooFromObj(). Reduces
	code duplication, and the resulting potential for inconsistency.

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Several changes:

	- Re-ordered error detection code so all values with trailing garbage
	  receive a "not an integer" message instead of an "integer too large"
	  message.
	- Removed inactive code meant to deal with strtoul* routines that fail
	  to parse leading signs. All of them do, and if any are detected that
	  do not, the correct fix is replacement with compat/strtoul*.c, not a
	  lot of special care by the callers.
	- Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj now avoids shimmering away a "wideInt" intrep.
	- Fixed Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj to agree with its documentation and with
	  Tcl_GetBoolean, accepting only "0" and "1" and not other numeric
	  strings. [Bug 1187123]
	- Added new private routine TclGetTruthValueFromObj to perform the more
	  permissive conversion of numeric values to boolean that is needed by
	  the [expr] machinery.

	* generic/tclInt.h (TclGetTruthValueFromObj):	New routine.
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Updated callers to call new routine.
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Updated callers to call new routine.
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:	Updated callers to call new routine.
	* generic/tclDictObj.c:	Updated callers to call new routine.
	* tests/obj.test:	Corrected bad tests that actually expected
	values like "47" and "0xac" to be accepted as booleans.

	* generic/tclLiteral.c: Disabled the code that forces some literals
	into the "int" Tcl_ObjType during registration. We can re-enable it if
	this change causes trouble, but it seems more sensible to let Tcl's
	"on-demand" shimmering rule, and not try to pre-guess things.

2005-04-16  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: force clenaup of the interp result in
	TclLoadFile(). Some implementations of TclpFindSymbol() will seed the
	interp result with error message when unable to find the requested
	symbol (this is not considered to be an error).

	Set of changes correcting huge memory waste (not a leak) when a thread
	exits. This has been introduced in 8.4.7 within an attempt to correctly
	cleanup after ourselves when Tcl library is being unloaded with the
	Tcl_Finalize() call.

	This fixes the [Bug 1178445]

	* generic/tclInt.h: added prototypes for TclpFreeAllocCache() and
	TclFreeAllocCache()

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: modified TclFinalizeThreadAlloc() to
	explicitly call TclpFreeAllocCache with the NULL-ptr as argument
	signalling cleanup of private tsd key used only by the threading
	allocator.

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: fixed TclpFreeAllocCache() to recognize when
	being called with NULL argument. This is a signal for it to clean up
	the tsd key associated with the threading allocator.

	* win/tclWinThrd.c: renamed TclWinFreeAllocCache to TclpFreeAllocCache
	and fixed to recognize when being called with NULL argument. This is a
	signal for it to clean up the tsd key associated with the threading
	allocator.

2005-04-13  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize): Lowest size limit
	* tests/io.test:	changed from ten bytes to one byte. Need for
	* tests/iogt.test:	this change was proven by Ross Cartlidge
	<rossc@cisco.com> where [read stdin 1] was grabbing 10 bytes followed
	by starting a child process that was intended to continue reading from
	stdin. Even with -buffersize set to one, nine chars were getting lost
	by the buffersize over reading for the native read() caused by [read].

2005-04-13  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpGetEncodingNameFromEnvironment): Reversed
	order of verifying candidate [encoding system] value, checking against
	a table in memory first before calling Tcl_GetEncoding and potentially
	scanning through the filesystem. Also ordered the table so that a
	binary search could be used within it. Improves startup time a bit more
	on some systems.

	on comp.lang.tcl that the current documentation was not clear.

2005-04-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:Commented out the functions
	TclPrintInstruction(), TclPrintObject() and TclPrintSource() when not
	debugging the compiler, as they are never called in that case.

2005-04-12  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c:	Corrected bad syntax of Tcl_Panic() call.

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetProcessGlobalValue):	More robust handling
	of bad TclInitProcessGlobalValueProc behavior; an immediate panic
	rather than a mysterious crash later.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:	Several changes to the way the
	encodingFileMap cache is maintained. Previously, it was attempted to
	keep the file map filled and up to date with changes in the encoding
	search path. This contributed to slow startup times since it required
	an expensive "glob" operation to fill the cache. Now the validity of
	items in the cache are checked at the time they are used, so the cache
	is permitted to fall out of sync with the encoding search path. Only
	[encoding names] and Tcl_GetEncodingNames() now pay the full expense.

2005-04-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

2005-03-07  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/string.n: Minor typo. [Bug 1158247]

2005-03-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: new peephole optimisation for INST_PUSH1; fixed
	the peephole opt in INST_POP so that it is not used when
	TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG is defined.

2005-03-04  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Changed [scan] to treat out-of-range floating

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclStrToD.c (Tcl_DoubleDigits, TclFormatNaN):
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_PrintDouble): Changed the signature of
	TclDoubleDigits so that it accepts a pointer to the signum of the
	argument, and returns the signum via that pointer. Added very hacky
	code to handle IEEE signed zeroes in Tcl_DoubleDigits. (It can't be
	done other than as a hack until C9x; C89 simply doesn't deal with the
	concept of -0.0). Added output conversion of tagged NaN values.
	* generic/tclBinary.c (FormatNumber): Changed to allow [binary format]
	to handle NaN.
	* tests/binary.test (binary-60.1): Added a quick-n-dirty test to make
	sure that NaN's can be scanned and formatted.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (GetLexeme, ParseMaxDoubleLength): Modified so
	that tagged NaN (e.g., NaN(DEADBEEF)) can be recognized.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclStrToD.c (Tcl_DoubleDigits):
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_PrintDouble, TclPrecTraceProc): Added
	Tcl_DoubleDigits to format 'double' numbers with the minimum number of
	significant digits to yield correct rounding. Modified tcl_precision
	to accept 0 as a precision (meaning "minimum digits"), and made 0 the
	default. [TIP #132]
	* generic/tclObj.c: Made NaN's throw an error in Tcl_GetDoubleFromObj.

	* tests/util.test: Corrected a number of tests that depended on
	tcl_precision, and removed the {eformat} condition from tests that no
	longer require it. Added a series of tests for correct rounding in

	Tcl_UniCharLen.

2005-02-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/variable.n: fix for [Bug 1124160], variables are detected by
	[info vars] but not by [info locals].

2005-02-11  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: remove SHLIB_LD_FLAGS (only for AIX, inlined into

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]

	* generic/tclStrToD.c (TclStrToD, RefineResult, SafeLdExp): Added code
	to ensure that 'ldexp' is never called with a value that will underflow
	* tests/expr.test: Added tests for the smallest representible value,
	and rounding between it and zero. (The tests reflect current
	behaviour; plan is to change the specification of Tcl so that input
	conversion of doubles underflows silently.)

2005-02-02  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclInitCompiledLocals): Add check for type of the
	framePtr->procPtr->bodyPtr passed to TclInitCompiledLocals and panic if
	it is not the correct type. If the body of the proc is not of the
	compiled byte code type then the code will crash. This was discovered
	while tracking down a crash in Itcl, that crash is fixed by Itcl patch
	1115085.

2005-02-01  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	[kennykb-numerics-branch]  Merged with HEAD as of today.

	'strtod' with a TclStrToD routine that performs correct rounding and
	handles denormals.
	* generic/tclStrToD.c: (new file)
	New scanning function for extracting 'double' from a string that rounds
	correctly, and handles denormals and infinities.
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	Added tclStrToD.c and the tommath routines that support it.

	These changes represent a partial implementation of TIP #132. Output
	conversion of floating point numbers, and proper handling of infinities
	within expressions, still need to be addressed.

2005-02-01  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj): Removed stray statement left
	behind in prior code reorganization.

	DBGX purge; these are still needed on some platforms to account for
	TCL_TRIM_DOTS. [Bug 1112654]

	* unix/configure: NOT REGENERATED: only have autoconf 2.59 here, need
	to find someone with autoconf 2.57.
