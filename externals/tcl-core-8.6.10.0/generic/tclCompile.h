 * offsets to jump to if a matching exception does occur. Exception ranges can
 * nest so this structure includes a nesting level that is used at runtime to
 * find the closest exception range surrounding a PC. For example, when a
 * break command is executed, the ExceptionRange structure for the most deeply
 * nested loop, if any, is found and used. These structures are also generated
