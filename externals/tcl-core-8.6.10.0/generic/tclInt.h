 * ERR_ALREADY_LOGGED:	Non-zero means information has already been logged in

 *			message log" command).
 * DONT_COMPILE_CMDS_INLINE: Non-zero means that the bytecode compiler should

 *			traces are requested.
 * RAND_SEED_INITIALIZED: Non-zero means that the randSeed value of the interp
 *			has not be initialized. This is set 1 when we first
 *			use the rand() or srand() functions.
 * SAFE_INTERP:		Non zero means that the current interp is a safe
 *			interp (i.e. it has only the safe commands installed,
 *			less privilege than a regular interp).
 * INTERP_DEBUG_FRAME:	Used for switching on various extra interpreter
 *			debug/info mechanisms (e.g. info frame eval/uplevel
 *			tracing) which are performance intensive.
 * INTERP_TRACE_IN_PROGRESS: Non-zero means that an interp trace is currently

 *			invoked.
 * INTERP_ALTERNATE_WRONG_ARGS: Used for listing second and subsequent forms
 *			of the wrong-num-args string in Tcl_WrongNumArgs.
 *			Makes it append instead of replacing and uses
 *			different intermediate text.
 * CANCELED:		Non-zero means that the script in progress should be
 *			canceled as soon as possible. This can be checked by
 *			extensions (and the core itself) by calling
 *			Tcl_Canceled and checking if TCL_ERROR is returned.
 *			This is a one-shot flag that is reset immediately upon
 *			being detected; however, if the TCL_CANCEL_UNWIND flag
