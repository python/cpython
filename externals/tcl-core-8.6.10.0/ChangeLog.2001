2001-12-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/init.tcl: make sure env(COMSPEC) on Windows is executed with
	the right case, as it may otherwise fail inexplicably.

2001-12-28  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (MemoryCmd, TclFinalizeMemorySubsystem): Added
	the [memory onexit] command, intended to replace [checkmem].

	* doc/DumpActiveMemory.3:
	* doc/memory.n: Updated documentation for [memory] and related
	matters. [Bug 487677]

	* mac/tclMacBOAMain.c (Tcl_Main, CheckmemCmd): Removed all the
	machinery for the [checkmem] command that is completely duplicated by
	code in generic/tclCkalloc.c.

	* generic/tclBinary.c:
	* generic/tclListObj.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Removed references to [checkmem] in
	comments, referencing [memory active] instead, since it is
	documented.

2001-12-28  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacTclCode.r: synced up tclInit features to unix/win:
	implemented TclSetPreInitScript support, use of existing tclInit proc
	if defined, check of default encoding dir if set. Changed script
	library resource names to lowercase (i.e. same as corresponding
	files). Used Tcl_JoinPath instead of string append. Check that system
	encoding could be loaded before utf translating the LibraryPath.
	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: minor version resources cleanup

2001-12-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG, SC_PATH_TKCONFIG):
	Search for config file using exec_prefix instead of prefix when no
	--with-tcl or --with-tk argument is used. [Bug 492418]

2001-12-21  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: fixed incorrect SHLIB_LD_LIBS setting for MacOSX /
	Darwin.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/mkLinks.tcl: improved case-insensitive filesystem support.
	* unix/mkLinks: Regen.

2001-12-19  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in (dist): corrected use of eolFix.tcl on working
	files. It should operate on distributed files. [Bug 495120]

2001-12-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse.in: Fix for [Bug 495120]. tcl.wse.in was stored in cvs
	with improper <eol>. This resulted in corrupted <eol> when checked-out
	on translating CVS clients such as windows (CRCRLF) and mac (CRCR).

2001-12-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Update SunOS 5.[0-6] target so that
	correct linker options are passed to gcc or ld. [Tk Bug 220863]

2001-12-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/README: Update to account for changes in the unix/dltest
	directory, the way autoconf is run, and the new "make shell" target.

2001-12-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Rename dltest to dlpkgs to fix problem where lib
	files were not getting built because dltest/ directory already
	existed.

2001-12-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialCheckProc): corrected time calculations to
	be unsigned. (schroedter)

2001-12-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Define new dltest target that simply does a cd to
	dltest/ before running make. There is no need for the separate
	configure script that was previously being used.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Subst into dltest/Makefile.
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Define LIBS using DL_LIBS, LIBS, and
	MATH_LIBS variables instead of TCL_LIBS variable from tclConfig.sh.
	* unix/dltest/README: Update readme to account for new configure free
	implementation.
	* unix/dltest/configure: Removed.
	* unix/dltest/configure.in: Removed.

2001-12-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_STUB_MAGIC): Added cast to force type to be an
	int and get rid of a persistent and pointless warning with SunPro
	compiler.

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (Tcl_AttemptDbCkalloc,Tcl_AttemptDbCkrealloc):
	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_AttemptDbCkalloc,Tcl_AttemptDbCkrealloc):
	Made the file parameters to these functions into CONST char *, like
	they always should have been to match the other Tcl*Db* API functions.

2001-12-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Applied [Bug 219311] on behalf of Rolf Schroedter
	<schroedter@users.sourceforge.net> to prevent fcopy on serial ports
	from flooding the event queue.

2001-12-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/CrtInterp.3:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: docs and comments corrections. [Bug 493412]
	Bug & patch by Don Porter.

2001-12-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_FinalizeNotifier): Stop Tcl on Windows from
	crashing when shutdown from a non-Tcl thread. Fixes [Bug 217982]
	[orig. 5804] reported by Hugh Vu and Gene Leache. I'm not convinced
	that the shutdown process is right even with this, but it was
	definitely wrong without...

2001-12-13  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Fix for [Bug 478565] reported
	by an unknown person. Bypasses all calls to "gethostbyaddr" for
	address "0.0.0.0" to prevent delays on Win/NT.

2001-12-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/Preserve.3: doc'd TCL_DYNAMIC use. [Patch 483989] (porter)

2001-12-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetsObj): Applied patch for [Bug 491341] as
	provided by Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>. Fixes the
	assumption of having an empty Tcl_Obj to work with.

2001-12-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: consistency patch, to make all instructions
	that pop a variable number of Tcl_Obj's off the execution stack take
	the number of popped objects as first operand. Modified *only* the new
	instructions INST_LIST_INDEX_MULTI and INST_LSET_FLAT, so this has no
	effect on bytecodes generated up to tcl8.4a3 inclusive.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: fix debug messages in INST_LSET_LIST.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileLindexCmd):
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileMathFuncCall): removed the last two
	overestimates of the necessary stack depth for bytecodes in the fix of
	[Bug 483611]

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): Applied Don Porter's patch
	fixing [Bug 437489].

2001-12-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-12-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/trace.test: restored consistency in refCount accounting by
	array traces [Bug 4484339], submitted by Don Porter.

2001-12-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/parseExpr.test, tests/for.test, tests/expr.test:
	* tests/expr-old.test, tests/compile.test, tests/compExpr.test
	* tests/compExpr-old.test: Kept up to date with syntax errors.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (ParsePrimaryExpr): Rewrote to give even
	better syntax errors in the fairly common case of an identifier
	without decorations by guessing based on the currently available
	functions. Also made messages consistent between memdebug and ordinary
	builds.

2001-12-05  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/trace.test: new algorithm for [array get], safe when there are
	traces that modify the array. [Bug 449893]

2001-12-04  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/compExpr-old.test, tests/compExpr.test, tests/compile.test:
	* tests/expr-old.test, tests/expr.test, tests/for.test:
	* tests/while.test, tests/if.test: Rewrite to handle more specific
	syntax errors.
	* tests/parseExpr.test: Rewrite to get rid of dup test numbers and
	handle more specific syntax errors.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (LogSyntaxError): Added a detail message
	argument to help explain what the syntax error is.
	(Tcl_ParseExpr, ParseCondExpr, ParsePrimaryExpr): Added detail
	messages.
	(UNKNOWN_CHAR): New lexeme for characters that are always illegal in
	expressions outside strings.

2001-12-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/expr.n: Various documentation improvements in relation to the
	function calls. Includes fix for [Bug 487704] submitted by Devin Eyre.

2001-12-03  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Some install target bugs repaired along with
	$(TCLSTUBLIB) added to the dependencies rather than implicit through
	the dde and reg extensions which don't happen to always require it for
	some build types.

2001-11-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: Tcl_Preserve'ing VarTrace structures to avoid
	memory corruption. Patch for [Bug 484334] provided by Don Porter

2001-11-29  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/namespace.test: modified namespace-41.2, added 41.3
	{knownbug} after discussion with Don Porter and Kevin Kenny.

2001-11-29  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/namespace.test: added namespace-41.2, a simpler test for
	[Bug 231259]

2001-11-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (BINARY_SCAN_MAX_CACHE, Tcl_BinaryObjCmd,
	(ScanNumber): Added caching scheme to reduce number of object
	allocations when doing scans of large repetitive binary strings. See
	comments in file for reasoning behind implementation. Suggested by
	Miguel Sofer in [Patch 429916], but independently implemented.

2001-11-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/regsub.n, doc/regexp.n: Converted dangling references to
	METASYNTAX section into references to the re_syntax manual page.

2001-11-27  D. Richard Hipp   <drh@hwaci.com>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: Fix a coredump in the filename normalizer code for
	Win95/98.

2001-11-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Removed the Tk reference for the 'winhelp' target.
	Converge at install will need to be the solution for Tk and all other
	extensions.

2001-11-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-24.2): Made test less sensitive to OS
	preemption, but perfection isn't practical. [Bug 463189, reported by
	Don Porter]

	* tests/switch.test (switch-9.*): Added tests to exercise more of the
	argument checking.  (switch-7.2,switch-7.3): Test changed behaviour
	slightly.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SwitchObjCmd): Reworked argument parsing to
	be stricter about what it accepts. This should make uses of the
	[switch] command be more maintainable. [Bug 475397, reported by Don
	Porter]

2001-11-26  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: 'make genstubs' after changes in
	2001-11-23 commit from Daniel Steffen.

2001-11-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add comments to better describe TCL_EXE and when
	it should be available.
	* win/Makefile.in: Add TCL_EXE variable to be used by rules like `make
	genstubs`. Don't set TCL_LIBRARY before running `make genstubs` since
	we will be running with a tclsh from the PATH not the one we build.

2001-11-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add comctl32.lib to wish link libs.
	This change was originally added to Tk on 2001-11-09 but was not
	committed to Tcl.

2001-11-23  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/install-sh:
	* unix/mkLinks:
	* unix/mkLinks.tcl:
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c:
	* unix/tclMtherr.c: Mac OSX support: build system, dynamic code loading
	and support for case-insensitive filesystems in mkLinks. [Patch 435258]

2001-11-23  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	Up-port to 8.4 of mac code changes for 8.3.3 & various new changes for
	8.4, some already backported to 8.3.4. [Patch 435658]

	* generic/tclObj.c: added #include to fix missing prototype errors

	* generic/tcl.h: MAC_TCL: addition of ConditionalMacros.h and use of
	DLLIMPORT and DLLEXPORT like on other platforms. ( => no longer need
	the .exp files and can remove use of #pragma export that never worked
	well)
	removed line continuation in #if clause as this breaks the mac
	resource compiler (note that *.r files include tcl.h)

	* mac/tclMacFile.c: fixed bug in permission checking code

	* mac/tclMacLoad.c: corrected utf8 handling, comparison of package
	names to code fragment names changed to only match on the length of
	package name, this allows for fragment names with version numbers
	appended.

	* mac/tclMacInt.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* mac/tclMacTime.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: moved declaration of TclpGetGMTOffset()

	* mac/tclMacShLib.exp:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.exp:
	* mac/tclMacMSLPrefix.h: removed files

	* unix/Makefile.in: removed reference to .exp files

	* mac/MW_TclBuildLibHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclBuildLibHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclHeaderCommon.h:
	* mac/MW_TclStaticHeader.h:
	* mac/MW_TclStaticHeader.pch: new precompiled header files

	* mac/MW_TclAppleScriptHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclHeader.pch:
	* mac/MW_TclTestHeader.pch:
	* mac/tclMacCommonPch.h: revised precompiled header handling: now
	include a common header file 'MW_TclHeaderCommon.h' from all .pch
	files, the .pch files themselves now only setup #defines (e.g.
	BUILD_tcl, STATIC_BUILD, TCL_DEBUG, TCL_THREADS) like in makefiles on
	other platforms.

	* mac/tclMac.h:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* mac/tclMacInt.h: use of BUILD_tcl and TCL_STORAGE_CLASS like on other
	platforms, standardize #include'd files to what's done on other
	platforms, removed use of #pragma export.

	* mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx: new archive of mac build support
	files & suggested build environment directory hierarchy:
	'Building MacTclTk' & 'CW Pro6 changes' readme's.
	projects for MoreFiles 1.5.2 static & shared libraries.
	project & sources for 'pseudoCarbonSupport', see below.
	included XML versions of the projects for CW Pro5 or Pro7 users.

	* mac/tclMacProjects.sea.hqx: updated mac build project files:
	build support for CodeWarrior Pro6, UnivIntf 3.4 & shared runtime
	libraries: the MSL libraries and MoreFiles are no longer compiled into
	Tcl.shlb, all non-static binaries now use the Pro6 shared runtime
	libraries and MoreFiles.shlb.  These shlbs are merged into the standard
	Wish and TclShell, but 3rd party applications linking with Tcl.shlb or
	Tk.shlb need to setup access to them.  (see the "(sh-ppc)" targets
	for how to do this.)
	included XML versions of the projects for CW Pro5 or Pro7 users.
	use compat/strtod.c instead of MSL's strtod()
	use WASTE versions of MSL for tcl test target to avoid text buffer
	cutoff at 32k.
	Merging the full MSL.shlb and the other shlbs into Wish & TclShell
	makes them a bit larger than before, use unmerged binaries to avoid
	copying the shared code with every application, e.g. when deploying
	numerous Wish based droplets.
	Note that using CW Pro5 to compile extensions is in principle still
	possible, but need to link with Pro6 runtime libraries.
	Tclapplescript now loads and runs on CFM68k.
	Highly experimental "pseudoCarbon" support for Tcl only on OS 8/9:
	binaries in "Build:(Carbon):" link against CarbonLib instead of
	InterfaceLib, however the actual code has not been carbonized! i.e. it
	will not run on OSX and may not even run properly with CarbonLib.
	This should in principle allow you to build & test OS9 CFM Carbon
	binaries that need to link with Tcl.shlb. On OSX you can use the
	native Tcl.framework, but you have to build a MachO binary as there
	is no CFM glue lib for Tcl.framework.
	the library pseudoCarbonSupport.shlb manually loads the symbols from
	InterfaceLib that are not in CarbonLib but are needed by the
	uncarbonized code in Tcl.shlb and TclShell.

	* generic/tclMain.c: MAC_TCL: workaround for broken/non-standard isatty
	on MW Pro6, #include <unistd.h> instead of defining isatty

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: MW Pro6 changes for MSL fcntl.h, stat.h & isatty

	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c: add EXTERN to InstallConsole to enable DLL
	export via the TCL_STORAGE_CLASS mechanism.

	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: fix for FSpDirectoryCopy API change

	* mac/tclMacLibrary.c: emit compile time error when
	TCL_REGISTER_LIBRARY and USE_TCL_STUBS are both defined at the same
	time in an extension, this use is not currently supported and will
	result in a crash when dynamically loading the extension.

	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: fixed obsolete copyrights/dates in version
	strings; updated version strings to standard usage; added support for
	'(Support Libraries)' subfolder for shared runtime libraries in
	unmerged binaries; commented out demo setting of "Tcl Environment
	Variables"; reorganized resources among these files to avoid multiple
	copies in applications and shared libraries, the script libraries are
	now no longer duplicated in Tclsh but are only included in the
	resources of Tcl.shlb.

	* mac/tclMacChan.c:
	* mac/tclMacSock.c: cast for *BlockMode

	* mac/tclMacUtil.c:
	* mac/tclMacMath.h: removed obsolete hypot() definition

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c:
	* mac/tclMacOSA.c:
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c:
	* generic/tclThreadTest.c: renamed routines conflicting with standard
	Apple or MoreFiles headers (at compile or link time):
	GetGlobalMouse         -> GetGlobalMouseTcl
	FSpGetDirectoryID      -> FSpGetDirectoryIDTcl
	FSpOpenResFileCompat   -> FSpOpenResFileCompatTcl
	FSpCreateResFileCompat -> FSpCreateResFileCompatTcl
	NewThread              -> NewTestThread
	the renamed MoreFiles *Tcl routines are just wrappers calling into the
	MoreFiles DLL.

	* mac/tclMacCommonPch.h:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c:
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: removed OLDROUTINENAMES define, renamed obsolete
	apple API names to modern equivalents; UH3.4 support: added #include
	<ControlDefinitions.h>, updated New*Proc() calls to New*UPP().

	* mac/tclMacUnix.c: added missing (Tcl_Obj ***) cast to
	Tcl_ListObjGetElements call

	* mac/tclMacAlloc.c: modernized TclpSysAlloc() to use temporary memory
	instead of system heap memory when available (MacOS >= 7.5 and
	possibly earlier, use of system heap has been discouraged for a long
	time and has many disadvantages, e.g. memory isn't paged out, and
	errors can very easily bring the system down); fixed crashing bug in
	TclpSysRealloc() and CleanUpExitProc() where memory was being accessed
	after having been deallocated; fixed memory leak in (de)allocation
	code (for every block ever allocated with TclpSysAlloc, a Ptr was
	leaked), if temporary memory is available, don't track allocated
	memory, instead use RecoverHandle() to get Handle from Ptr, otherwise
	use doubly linked list to correctly track memory and free all
	allocated memory; added new option for ConfigureMemory:
	MEMORY_DONT_USE_TEMPMEM, disables use of temporary memory even when it
	would be available, only necessary when writing e.g. a driver (using
	tcl??); increased fraction of application heap reserved for OS
	routines to 512K

	* compat/strftime.c:
	* mac/tclMacTime.c:
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: timezone support for mac via TclpGetTZName()
	like on windows, using an inverse timezone table adapted from
	tclDate.c to map gmtoffset in seconds gotten from the MacOS APIs to a
	timezone string, as there is no good way to get this info from MacOS.
	I had to make up some unusual timezones and arbitrarily decide on the
	most standard of the multiple choices available for every timezone.

	* generic/tclExecute.c: workaround for a MSL bug/misfeature: for very
	small floats, MSL can return errno ERANGE but a non-zero value (<
	LDBL_MIN however)

	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c: support for WASTE text library using temporary
	memory, setting has no effect if WASTE is not used.

	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: removed duplicate code from generic/tclPanic.c
	and added that file to projects instead.

	* tests/all.tcl: set tcltest::singleProcess 1 as multiple processes
	are not available on the mac.

	* tests/cmdAH.test: access time not available on the mac, skip the
	atime touch test

	* tests/appendComp.test:
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:
	* tests/compile.test:
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/lset.test:
	* tests/namespace.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test: added missing cleanups/tests/catches that caused
	tests to fail on the mac.

	* doc/tclvars.n: doc bug, env(PWD) should be env(HOME) [Bug 463834]

2001-11-21  Don Porter	<dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-8.8): Corrected test for Bug 219393.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken,CallCommandTraces):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ>c (Tcl_UntraceCommand):  Added Tcl_Preserve and
	Tcl_Release calls to prevent deletion of CommandTrace structures until
	all callers are done using them, preventing memory corruption. [Bug
	453805]

	Changed all uses of TclpGetTime to Tcl_GetTime. Added Tcl_GetTime to
	the Stubs table and the library documentation. Added a TclpGetTime in
	tclUtil.c for backward compatibility of extensions. [Patch 483500,
	TIP#73]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): Corrected an error in the
	[time] command that caused incorrect results to be returned if the
	total duration of all iterations exceeded 2**31 microseconds. [Bug
	478847]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.h: Reran 'make genstubs'

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: moving all code relative to bytecodes from
	tclBasic.c to tclExecute.c - the functions RecordTracebackInfo and
	Tcl_ExprObj went to tclExecute.c, and new interface function was
	defined (TclCompEvalObj).
	The final objective of this sequence of moves is to provide a clean,
	clear-cut interface between Tcl's core and the compiler/engine
	subsystem.

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: factoring out of common code in tclBasic.c
	(new function TclInterpReady defined: it resets the interp's result,
	then checks that it hasn't been deleted and that the nesting level is
	acceptable). Passed the responsibility of calling it to the *callers*
	of TclEvalObjvInternal.

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c
	* generic/tclExecute.c: a better variant of the previous-to-last
	commit (restoring numLevels computations). The managing of the levels
	now has to be done by the *callers* of TclEvalObjvInternal

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: missing variable declaration under
	TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG.

2001-11-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c: restoring the computations of iPtr->numLevels to
	the original logic (previous to buggy modifs on 2001-11-16).

2001-11-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tools/eolFix.tcl (new-file):
	* unix/Makefile.in: added EOL correction for Windows bat files to
	dist target. [Bug 219409] (davygrvy)

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): update of patch from
	2001-11-16 that uses the old Tcl encoding check mechanism as a
	fallback to the original. Also added a TCL_DEFAULT_ENCODING #define
	(defaults to iso8859-1). Tcl will first try setlocale and nl_langinfo,
	and if that fails, guess based on certain LANG|LC_* env vars. [Patch
	418645]

2001-11-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/buildall.vc.bat:  Added useful comments.

2001-11-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compile.test: added a test for bug [Bug 483309]

2001-11-19  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* doc/file.n:
	* tests/winFCmd.test: improved speed of file normalization for
	Win95/98, and clarified docs on differences in file normalization
	between NT/2000 and the older operating systems. Added test to ensure
	normalization is correct.

2001-11-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclParse.c: Code reorganisation. Moved all evaluation
	functions from tclParse.c to tclBasic.c, so that now tclParse.c deals
	exclusively with parsing and all evaluations are done by code in
	tclBasic.c. The functions moved are: TclEvalObjvInternal,
	Tcl_EvalObjv, Tcl_LogCommandInfo, Tcl_EvalTokensStandard,
	Tcl_EvalTokens, Tcl_EvalEx, Tcl_Eval, Tcl_EvalObj and
	Tcl_GlobalEvalObj.

2001-11-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-8.8): Added adapted version of [Bug 219393]
	as new test; the test won't reliably show up the old problem unless it
	is being run under something like Purify, but something is better than
	nothing...

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_TraceVar2, Tcl_UntraceVar2): Added missing
	mask bits for trace result type and a check for a nonsense flag
	combination.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceVarProc): Added missing test for NULL when
	deleting a trace that doesn't cause an error.

	* doc/TraceVar.3: Added documentation for change due to TIP#68.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceVarInfo): Removed problematic errMsg field
	from structure.
	(TraceVarProc): Removed references to errMsg field and changed
	handling of errors so that they returned a Tcl_Obj* containing the
	error string. This minimizes the number of calls to the memory
	management subsystem.
	(TclTraceCommandObjCmd, TraceCommandProc): Removed references to
	errMsg field which was never used in command traces in any case.
	(Tcl_TraceObjCmd, TclTraceVariableObjCmd): Removed references to
	errMsg field and made variable traces register with
	TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT bit set.

	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_TRACE_RESULT_DYNAMIC,TCL_TRACE_RESULT_OBJECT):
	New constants to define how to handle the strings returned from trace
	callbacks [TIP#68]
	* generic/tclVar.c (CallTraces, Tcl_GetVar2Ex, TclGetIndexedScalar,
	(TclGetElementOfIndexedArray, Tcl_SetVar2Ex, TclSetIndexedScalar,
	(TclSetElementOfIndexedArray, Tcl_UnsetVar2, Tcl_ArrayObjCmd,
	(TclDeleteVars, TclDeleteCompiledLocalVars, DeleteArray,
	(TclVarTraceExists): Support for those new trace flags.

2001-11-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: patch for [Bug 483309] (petasis).

2001-11-16  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c: removed a C++-style comment that was
	inadvertently left in the source code.

2001-11-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/interp.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (SlaveObjCmd): Corrected argument checking for
	'$interp alias|aliases|issafe'. [Patch 479560] (thoyts, hobbs)

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: added HAVE_LANGINFO code block.
	* unix/configure: regened
	* unix/configure.in: added SC_ENABLE_LANGINFO call
	* unix/tcl.m4: made SHLIB_LD_LIBS='${LIBS}' for FreeBSD* (meyer)
	Added modified version of Wagner patch to make use of nl_langinfo
	where possible to determine Unix platform encoding, instead of the
	inflexible built-in system. This is used by default when possible, and
	can be disabled with --enable-langinfo=no. [Patch 418645] (hobbs,
	wagner)

2001-11-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclObj.c: moved Tcl_GetCommandFromObj and all defining code
	for tclCmdNameType objects to tclObj.c (from tclExecute.c). This code
	has nothing to do with bytecodes.

2001-11-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/stack.test: consolidation of duplicated code (in
	TclExecuteByteCode and EvalObjv); renaming of EvalObjv to TclEvalObjv
	as it is not static anymore; restored consistency of level counts
	between compiled and directly evaled code. [Bug 480896]

2001-11-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:

	[lset] command. Both commands are byte-code compiled. [Patch 471874]
	(work by Kenny, commited by Hobbs)

2001-11-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/buildall.vc.bat(new):
	* win/makefile.vc:  Small fix with deriving the "OriginalFilename"
	string in the .rc scripts. Added a quick batchfile for building the
	entire thing.

2001-11-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* doc/file.n:
	* doc/tcltest.n: converted use of \' to more reasonable format.

2001-11-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Add "make gdb" target. This target can run tclsh
	inside either gdb or insight.

2001-11-10  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:  Added a check to make sure one runs the makefile
	from the /win directory only.

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat:  Changes from Llyod Lim for better stability.
	[Patch 456759]

2001-11-09  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/tcl.dsp:  winhelp target fixes for non-NT systems. It seems
	NMAKE under these remembers changed directories during commands. A new
	tcltest feature from Peter Spjuth <peter.spjuth@space.se> to specify a
	pattern file from the commandline and redirecting output to a file
	when not under NT with it's scrollback console. Then it replays it,
	piped through more. Added 2 new static "configurations" to tcl.dsp.
	I could keep adding more, but I think we should leave it up to the
	user for customizing it.

	Sticky-points left:  'profile' option.

2001-11-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fixup stack size under OSF1. [Patch 474790]

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Add HAVE_PTHREAD_ATTR_SETSTACKSIZE define to
	EXTRA_CFLAGS to adjust initial stack size.

2001-11-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Enable thread support under FreeBSD. [Bug 473708]

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Check for pthread functions in
	libc_r and enable thread support if found.
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Set SHLIB_LD_LIBS and use it in the
	Makefile to properly link a shared library.

2001-11-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Avoid adding libc to the LIBS variable
	since it is not needed when linking with CC. If required when linking
	with LD it should be done on a case by case basis in tcl.m4.

2001-11-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/makefile.vc:  Fixed install target to adjust for the different
	build types. Added a 'linkexten' option to link the win extensions
	inside the shell when built static. Placed win/tclAppInit.c patch in
	SF patch DB for approval. 'profile' option not hooked in yet.
	Everything else know is done.

	* win/tcl.dsp(new):
	* win/tcl.dsw(new):  Simple MsDev stub project files that calls
	makefile.vc. Will help run Tcl in the debugger easier without
	confusing MsDev for where the .pdb files are.

2001-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Print a message indicating that the user should run
	"make genstubs" when the generated tclStubInit.c file is out of date.
	We can't regenerate automatically since there may be no tclsh on the
	system and that would cause bootstrap problems. [Bug 465874]

2001-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC in tclConfig.sh. It should be included by
	extensions that need to find Tcl include headers in the install
	location. The user can override the include install dir with
	--includedir so we need to record this information for extensions.
	[Bug 421835]

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.
	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.
	* win/tclConfig.sh.in: Define TCL_INCLUDE_SPEC.

2001-11-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/makefile.vc: Dropped the NOMSVCRT macro and put it on the option
	list instead. It makes more sense to me this way as NOMSVCRT=0 would
	only be the valid setting. Fixed the dde and reg extension for
	building static. Improved, but not perfected, the winhelp target.

2001-11-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Change minimum VC++ version to 5.X since 4.X is known
	not to work.
	Indicate that Mingw is required and building with Cygwin gcc is not
	supported. Include instructions that indicate how to install Mingw and
	what URLs folks should use to download the supported version of Mingw.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Error out if user tries to compile the Windows
	version of Tcl with Cygwin gcc. Users should compile with Mingw gcc
	instead.

2001-11-06  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (ReadChars): Fixed [Bug 478856] reported by Stuart
	Cassoff <stwo@users.sourceforge.net>. The bug caused loss of
	fileevents when [read]ing less data from the channel than buffered.
	Due to an empty input buffer the flag CHANNEL_NEED_MORE_DATA was set
	but never reset, causing the I/O system to wait for more data instead
	of using a timer to synthesize fileevents and to flush the pending
	data out of the buffers.

2001-11-06  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc (new):
	* win/makefile.vc:  Complete over/under rewrite to support numerous
	build options all from the commandline itself without needing to edit
	the makefile. Now requires vcvars32.bat to be run prior to running
	nmake for bootstraping the environment. Fully doc'd usage for it is in
	makefile.vc. Commentary welcome. Sticky points left are:

	1) winhelp target shows errors in the converting script.
	2) .rc scripts aren't getting the right #defines to build the correct
	   "OriginalFilename" strings. (have patch, won't commit yet)
	3) Naming convention with suffixes describing the buildtype are 'tsdx'
	   which will need public acceptance. ie. tclsh84tsx.exe is a (t)
	   threaded shell (s) statically linked to the core and (x) uses
	   msvcrt instead of libcmt.

2001-11-04  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl: made filesystem fallback proc ::tcl::CopyDirectory
	more robust to vagaries of non-native filesystems.

2001-11-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: updated documentation and comments to clarify
	behaviour of 'file copy' wrt soft links.

2001-10-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: fix to '-types {f r}' bug in TclpMatchInDirectory
	(which could cause a UMR, as well as returning wrong results). Also
	improved API for 'stat' to resolve [Bug 219258].
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c
	* win/tclWinInt.h: addition of improved stat API to internal lookup
	table.
	* tests/fileName.test: two new tests for the above bug.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: some cleanup of comments and #ifdefs

2001-10-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): Argument to access() was
	entryPtr->d_name instead of nativeEntry which failed when trying to
	check access for files in other than the current directory. [Bug
	475941, reported by Georgios Petasis]

2001-10-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: Added stateUpdated member to struct TtyState.
	(TtyCloseProc,TtySetOptionProc,TtyInit): Use stateUpdated member of
	TtyState to decide whether it is necessary to reset a serial port when
	Tcl closes it. Blindly resetting can cause Tcl to be sent an
	unexpected SIGTSTP when it is executing in the background [Bug 471374,
	reported by Chris Nelson]

2001-10-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/ObjectType.3: Minor documentation fix, reported by David N.
	Welton <davidw@users.sourceforge.net> directly to me.

2001-10-22  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: fix to stop test suite from hanging process under
	some versions of WinNT. [Bug 466102] (Kevin Kenny)

	* generic/tclGetDate.y (RelativeMonth): corrected off-by-one-day error
	in clock scan with relative months and years during swing hours. [Bug

2001-10-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclLoadAout.c (TclGuessPackageName): removed unused vars and
	fixed warnings. [Bug 446622] (lim)

2001-10-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c: changing a memcmp to strncmp to avoid a memory
	error detected by purify (thanks Jeff); modify style to agrre with the
	style guide.

2001-10-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls (TclExpandCodeArray,TclGetInstructionTable):
	Added to internal stubs table. Tclcompiler (Tclpro project) needs them
	if used as loadable package under Windows. Changed signatures. We
	don't want to describe compiler internal structures in "tclInt.h".

	* generic/tclCompile.h: S.a. Removed function declarations.
	* generic/tclCompile.c: S.a. Adapted to changed signatures.

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:

	* win/configure.in:
	* win/tcl.m4: reworked to be a little cleaner in comparison to each
	other, and to AC_SUBST even empty vars for win/tclConfig.sh

	* generic/tclFileName.c: minor code cleanup

	* generic/tcl.h: moved #define of WIN32 to tcl.h where __WIN32__ is
	defined and added #ifndef check.

	* doc/open.n: moved all fconfigure option docs to fconfigure.n
	* doc/fconfigure.n: added serial config options

	* win/tclWinChan.c:

	* generic/tclFCmd.c: fix to memory leak in TclFileDeleteCmd on
	certain error conditions.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: fix to typo.

2001-10-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tools/encoding/tis-620.txt: TIS-620 charset mapping.
	[Patch 467423] (poonlap)

	* tests/http.test: added removeFile for outdata

	* tests/ioCmd.test: added catch around file removal, as Windows file
	locking throws errors.

	* tests/socket.test (socket-7.2): corrected to work on Win2K.

2001-10-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/compile.test: new tests for [Bug 467523]; they are only
	effective if TCL_MEM_DEBUG was set during compilation.

2001-10-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c (TclReleaseLiteral): insured that
	self-referential bytecodes are properly cleaned up on interpreter
	deletion [Bug 467523] (Ronnie Brunner)

2001-10-10  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:  #include <winsock2.h> needed to get moved to
	after #include <windows.h> or wierd misunderstandings took place when
	-D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0400 is set for outside code that requires knowledge
	of Tcl innards. General header macro magic applied liberally...

	* tests/unixInit.test:	Corrected restore of ::env(LANG).

2001-10-09  Jeff Hobbs	<jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_SplitPath): corrected mem leak intro'd
	with VFS code where the result obj from Tcl_FSSplitPath was not
	getting freed.

2001-10-09  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c: (TclReleaseLiteral) reverted previous patch
	for [Bug 467523] - cure is worse than the illness.

2001-10-05  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclLiteral.c: (TclReleaseLiteral) insured that
	self-referential bytecodes are properly cleaned up on interpreter
	deletion. [Bug 467523] (Ronnie Brunner)

	include big5, gb or euc* as those have different formats in the latest

2001-10-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_FinalizeThread): moved freeing of

2001-10-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure: regen'ed
	* win/tcl.m4:
	* win/makefile.vc: added Win64 SDK RC1 compilation support
	* win/Makefile.in: added $(LDFLAGS_CONSOLE) to TCLSH, TCLTEST and
	PIPE_DLL_FILE targets to get the link flags

	* win/tclWinInit.c: minor 64bit casts

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c: removed unnecessary inclusion of

	* doc/lsort.n: Improved doc...
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsortObjCmd, SortCompare): Made
	offset-from-end indexing work, and factored out some "magic numbers"
	for easier understanding. [Bug 465674]
	* tests/cmdIL.test (cmdIL-1.26): Added test for offset-from-end
	indexing for lsort.

2001-09-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: fix to performance issue reported by jcw in
	which 'access("")' is called unnecessarily when normalizing any
	absolute path.
	* generic/tclIO.c: added '(ClientData)' cast to calls to
	Tcl_(Preserve|Release) newly introduced, fixing compile error on
	Windows.

2001-09-26  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/fileevent.n: Accepted [Patch 465279] adding an example to the
	fileevent manpage. Minor modifications to get a better formatting.
	Report and patch by David N. Welton <davidw@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* The changes below fix [Bug 462317] where Expect tried to read more
	than was in the buffers and then blocked in the OS call as its pty
	channel driver provides no blockmodeproc through which the OS could be
	notified of blocking-behaviour. Because of this the general I/O core
	has to take more care than usual to preserve the semantics of
	non-blocking channels.

	The problem was reported by "Kevin O'Gorman" <kevin@kosmanor.com>.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ReadRaw): Do not read from the driver if the
	channel is non-blocking and the fileevent causing the read was
	generated by a timer. We do not know if there is data available from
	the OS. Instead of going to the OS for more and potentially blocking
	we simply signal EWOULDBLOCK to the higher levels to cause the system
	to wait for true fileevents.
	(GetInput): Same as before.
	(ChannelTimerProc): Added set and clear of CHANNEL_TIMER_FEV.

	* generic/tclIO.h (CHANNEL_TIMER_FEV): New flag for channels. Is set
	if a fileevent was generated by a timer, the channel is not blocking
	and the driver did not provide a blockmodeproc. In that case the I/O
	core has to be especially careful about going to the driver for more
	data.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory, NativeStat):  Vince Darley
	reports the 2001-09-24 TIP 27 changes left the win directory CONST
	poisoned. These changes should fix that.

	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs

2001-09-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-09-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	The change below fixes [Bug 464380]. The bug was reported by Ronnie
	Brunner <rbrunner@users.sourceforge.net>. He also provided the patch.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Moved release of 'tclLibraryPath'
	to Tcl_FinalizeThread.
	(Tcl_FinalizeThread): See above, new place for release of
	'tclLibraryPath'.

2001-09-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tools/encoding/cp1252.txt: File was missing part of the encoding
	[euro, ZCaron and zcaron].

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: Add docs for Tcl_OutputBuffered; remove some old
	changebars.

2001-09-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): corrected INST_STR_CMP
	else case for strings to pass true utf char length to Tcl_UtfNCmp.

2001-09-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: added extra processor definitions. (mstacy)

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketThread): corrected pointer cast for _WIN64.

	* win/tclWinNotify.c: removed unnecessary winsock include (it is
	already in from tclWinPort.h).

	* win/tclWinPort.h: changed winsock.h include to winsock2.h. Reverses
	change from 2000-11-16, but is necessary for WIN64. Extensions should
	comply with defined OS words, or use #ifndef.

2001-09-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/socket.test: removed dependence on being run from same dir as
	remote.tcl, which only now needs to be in the same dir as this file.
	[Bug 219326]

2001-09-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestcmdtokenCmd): corrected pointer
	storage/retrieval for 64bit machines.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd):
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): corrected handling of format and
	scan on 64-bit machines. [Bug 412696] (rmax)

	* unix/configure: regen'ed
	* unix/tcl.m4: added --enable-64bit support for HP-11 with the 64-bit
	kernel.

	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/cmdInfo.test: improved skip reporting of missing commands

	* tests/winFCmd.test: simplified error check for winFCmd-7.9

	* tests/winPipe.test: removed obsolete cat16 tests

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): fixed invalid usage of
	valuePtr in TRACE_WITH_OBJ in INST_EVAL_STK case. [Bug 462594] Changed
	INST_STR_CMP instruction to promote to Unicode strings only when one
	of the strings is already of Unicode type.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):
	* generic/tclCompile.c (instructionTable):
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): INST_STR_MATCH -
	Updated to Int1 instruction type and added special case to use
	INST_STR_EQ instead when no glob chars are specified in a static
	string.

	* tests/{for.test,foreach.test,if.test,while.test}:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileForCmd, TclCompileForeachCmd,
	TclCompileIfCmd, TclCompileWhileCmd): Corrected the overaggressive
	compiling of loop bodies enclosed in ""s.  [Bug 219166] (msofer)

2001-09-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: insured that execution stack errors are also
	detected at abnormal returns.

2001-09-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Added documentation to mention what happens when a
	server socket is created with port=0. Removed an old change bar, and
	no new change bar because Tcl has always behaved this way as it is
	really a poorly-documented standards-defined OS feature.

	* tests/util.test (util-8.1): Test derived from code to detect the
	problem, but the test always works in the C locale, so beware if you
	are maintaining the code.
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclNeedSpace): Rewrote to be UTF-8 aware. [Bug
	411825, but not that patch which would have added extra spaces if
	there was a real non-ASCII space involved.]

2001-09-18 Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_PutsObjCmd): Rewritten to have saner and
	faster argument handling. [Bug 123552], [Patch 402564] (fellows)

2001-09-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): On Linux, disable inlining when one
	of the compat/*.c routines is to be linked in. [Patch 440891]

2001-09-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: removed forced #define USE_TCLALLOC 1 for Windows.
	This means the native system allocator will be used by default. This
	should be binary and source compatible with extensions, as Tcl_Alloc
	is a properly stubbed function.

2001-09-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: corrected small bug in [Patch 456668] - the
	varFramePtr was not restored in one possible exit.

2001-09-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tclvars.n:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclProc.c: disabled all compile and execution tracing
	functionality in standard builds; TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG is now necessary
	to enable it. [Bug 451858]

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/configure.in:
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl: Fixed version numbers from bogus tcl
	versions to independent versions for dde and registry packages.

2001-09-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexp.test (regexp-20.1):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): had to adjust fix from
	2001-08-06 to actually duplicate the objects in certain cases. This is
	really a place where feather would have been essential. [Bug 461322]

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfPrev): corrected to return the proper
	location when the middle of a UTF-8 byte was passed in [Tk Bug 450504]

	* ChangeLog.1999:
	* ChangeLog: broke changes from 199x into ChangeLog.1999 to reduce
	size of the main ChangeLog.

2001-09-13  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioCmd.test: Changed the computation of the result for
	iocmd-8.1[123] so that the tests work for single- and multi-process
	execution of the testsuite. Depending on the choice of the user stdout
	is a tty or not and thus reports different channel options. Fixes
	[460993] reported by Don Porter.

2001-09-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/ParseCmd.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObjCmd):
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* tests/parse.test: Deprecate the use of Tcl_EvalTokens, replaced by
	the new Tcl_EvalTokensStandard. The new function performs the same
	duties but adheres to the standard return convention for Tcl
	evaluations; the deprecated function could only return TCL_OK or
	TCL_ERROR, which caused [Bug 219384] and [Bug 455151]. This patch
	implements [TIP 56].

2001-09-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Invert the logic that checks for $GCC. Instead of
	checking for "$GCC" = "no" we check for "$GCC" != "yes" or simply swap
	the true and false blocks of code in an if statement. That way if GCC
	is set to "" everything will still work. [Bug 460991]

2001-09-12  Don Porter <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/appendComp.test:
	* tests/lsearch.test:
	* tests/namespace.test:
	* tests/rename.test:
	* tests/split.test:  Corrected tests to better isolate tests in one
	file from influencing tests in other files. [Bug 460591]

2001-09-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls: reserved stub #481 for the implementation of
	[TIP 56]

2001-09-11  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: Added documentation for Tcl_WriteRaw and
	Tcl_ReadRaw [Bug 414929].

	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Added documentation for Tcl_ChannelBuffered and
	Tcl_GetTopChannel [Bug 414929].

	* The changes below are a fix for [Bug 219253].

	* tests/socket.test: Removed _most_ instances of hardwired port
	numbers for listening sockets. Remaining are the ports in all tests
	with constraint 'doTestsWithRemoteServer'. These seem to be designed
	for a more controlled environment and are usually skipped when running
	the testsuite.

	* tests/io.test: Removed all instances of hardwired port numbers for
	listening sockets.

2001-09-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclInExit): Corrected handling of tsd in late
	stages of finalization. [Bug 419449] (darley)

	* tests/stack.test:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasObjCmd): Check the numLevels to ensure
	that we aren't hitting some alias loop condition. [Bug 443184]

2001-09-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't include . characters in the
	Tcl library name when building on FreeBSD 3.X and later systems.
	[Patch 450725]

2001-09-10  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tclsh.1:
	* doc/Tcl_Main.3:
	* doc/CrtChannel.3:
	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3:
	* doc/GetStdChan.3: Enhanced the manpages with cross-references to
	the new manpage and more explanations how these functions deal with
	the standard channels in various situations.

	* doc/StdChannels.3: New manpage describing handling of the standard
	channels by the Tcl library. [Bug 402725]

2001-09-10  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/mkLinks (Tcl_FSLink): Updated to reflect 2001-08-23 file system
	changes.

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c:  Added #include of tclInt.h; access to Tcl
	internals, notably TclpUnloadFile(), is required. Thanks to Bob
	Techentin for report and patch. [Bug 459305]

	* generic/tclInitScript.h (initScript):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TCL_REGISTRY_KEY, TclpSetVariables):  Removed
	vestiges of Tcl's old initialization from registry variables. [Bug
	455645]

2001-09-10  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls: Also added 'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels' to the
	  internal platform specific stub table.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjStat): Now added the call to
	'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels' to this function. I don't know where my
	head was last thursday (2001-09-06), but the call was actually added
	to 'TclpObjChdir', i.e. the implementation of [cd]. Corrected this
	now. Thanks to Vince Darley for spotting this.

2001-09-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/proc.test: made [proc] bytecompile a no-op for procs defined
	with _args_ as single argument and an empty body. [FRQ 451441]

2001-09-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Use () around variable name instead of {}. Use
	TCLTEST variable directly instead of depending on the tcltest alias.

2001-09-09  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: Reminder from David Cuthbert
	<dacut@kanga.org> that I hadn't finished the Borland compatibility
	stuff. [Patch 436116]

2001-09-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Modify cmdAH-20.5 and cmdAH-24.8 to display the
	file atime or mtime results if the test fails.

2001-09-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat: made these text files, text files again. [Patch 451333]

2001-09-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/mkd.bat:
	* win/rmd.bat: Apply binary property (cvs admin -kb) to files and
	convert to CRLF linefeed format to fix the VC++ build. [Bug 219409]

2001-09-08 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclFCmd.c:
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: removed Tcl_FSCopyFile fallback to channel
	copying, since the channels will not have access to interpreters and
	the channel copying currently requires an interp. Code which required
	cross-platform copies always has interpreters, so that solves the
	problem. Fixes bug in TclKit.

2001-09-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tcl.m4: Added -link50compat option so a VC6 linker makes a VC5
	(pre sp3) compatible import library. [Bug 219257]

2001-09-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpThreadExit): Cast status argument to
	_endthreadex to unsigned instead of DWORD to match the Win32 function
	prototype.

2001-09-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All the changes below serve to fix bug [219148] which reports a 80x
	performance hit for file I/O on Win* systems. On my system it was
	closer to a 120x hit. Problem report by Uwe Traum <no email address
	available>.

	The fix goes like this: The obstacle is 'FlushFileBuffers', executed
	whenever Tcl writes data to the OS, as Tcl has to wait for the disk to
	complete I/O, and disks are slow. We remove that obstacle. This opens
	another problem, [file size] reports back wrong numbers. So for [file
	size] we add the call back in. As optimization we keep track of the
	channels which were written to and flush only these.

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjStat): Added a call to
	'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels'. This ensures that [file size] and related
	commands report the correct size of a file even if Tcl has recently
	written to it. Unixoid OS's always report the correct size even for
	files with pending data, but Win* syssystem don't. They only report
	what is actually on disk.

	* win/tclWinInt.h: Added declaration of 'TclWinFlushDirtyChannels',
	making it available to other parts of the tcl core.

	* win/tclWinChan.c (TclWinFlushDirtyChannels): New, internal,
	procedure. Goes through the list of open file channels and forces the
	OS to flush its file buffers for all which were written to since the
	last call of this function. This is an expensive operation as Tcl has
	to wait for the OS to complete actual writes to the disk.

	(FileInfo): Added dirty flag required by the procedure above.

	(FileOutputProc): Removed flushing of file buffers, setting the dirty
	flag instead. This means that the previously incurred delays do not
	happen anymore.

	(TclWinOpenFileChannel): Added initialization of 'dirty' flag.

2001-09-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/http.n: noted -binary, charset and coding state keys.
	* tests/http.test:
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): correctly get charset parameter
	and convert text according to specified encoding (if known). RFC
	iso8859-1 is used by default. Also recognize Content-encoding to see
	if we should do binary translation. Added a CYA -binary switch for the
	cases that were missed. [Bugs 219211, 219399]

	* tests/ioUtil.test: changed to make better use of constraints and
	remove knownBug constraints that weren't valid.

2001-09-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-3.2): Updated test to support newer
	HP-UX releases that properly report euc-jp as the system encoding for
	Japanese. Bug report and patch verification by Bob Techentin. [Bug
	453883]

	* doc/http.n:
	* library/http/*.tcl:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* tools/tclmin.wse:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/{Mm}akefile.*:  Updated http package to version 2.4, reflecting
	the new features just added.

2001-09-06 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c: tests of old-fs hooks no longer cause problems in
	threaded builds. Also removed unused unload proc.
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclIOUtilc: added Tcl_FSMountsChanged so that a vfs can
	inform the filesystem that the filesystem epoch must be changed (since
	cached filesystems may now be incorrect). Fixes problem running tclvfs
	extension.
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: if tests aren't in a native filesystem,
	then don't use pipes to run them. [Bug 458741]

2001-09-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.decls (479 generic):
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Seek,Tcl_Tell,Tcl_OutputBuffered): Added public
	function to return the size of the output buffer and reworked other
	channel functions to use this shared functionality and that of
	Tcl_InputBuffered() too. [TIP#49, Rolf Schroedter]

2001-09-05  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:  Another small trim finalizing Borland
	support.

	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:  More Borland compatibility fixes. Changed EDQUOT
	#define from 49 to 69. Borland had a clash as it was already using
	this number. Upon advice from Helmut Giese, EDQUOT has been found in
	other header files #defined as 69. [Patch 436116]

	* win/.cvsignore:  A few more glob patterns added.

	* win/makefile.bc (new):  Borland lives once more! rejoice..
	* generic/tclAlloc.c: Small Borland compatibility fix.
	* win/tclWinTime.c:  More Borland compatibility fixes. [Patch 436116]

2001-09-05 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: made notWin2000 constraint false if not running
	on Windows at all.

2001-09-04  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Revisited _beginthreadex() stuff. Instead of
	assuming a c-runtime implimentation of _beginthreadex normal, I
	reversed the logic to not assume, and use when is by explicitly
	needing to add runtimes that support it such as Borland.

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:  Borland compatibility change so ClientData
	was properly typed as a void* and TCHAR would not be defined twice.

	* generic/tcl.h:  Removed a small mistake from before. Changes to the
	EXTERN macro for proper Borland compatibility will have to see a TIP.
	What's this with the MS compiler:

		__declspec(dllexport) int func (int a, int b);

	will have to be this with Borland:

		int __cdecl __export func (int a, int b);

	The order of the attribute needs to be after the return type.

2001-09-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* compat/strtod.c (strtod):  Fixed failure to handle expressions like
	3eq2 and failure to set errno on overflow. [Bug 440894]

2001-09-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/proc.test: made [proc] check that formal args have simple
	names. [Bug 458548]

2001-09-04 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Minor bug fixes in filesystem, plus small vfs changes as a result of
	enabling the test filesystem to work properly.
	* tests/fileName.test: ensure new test cleans up after itself
	* doc/filename.n:
	* generic/tclFileName.c: improved Mac path handling and document why
	[Bug 421842] on Windows handling of UNC paths is not valid.
	Documentation and code now much clearer on what is and is not a UNC
	path.
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c:
	* generic/tclFCmd.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fixed error message, fixed [Bug 453512] about
	dangerous use of tmpnam, replaced with mkstemp. Documented all the
	changes.
	* generic/tclTest.c: made test vfs fully functional as a 'reporting
	filesystem'.
	* generic/tcl.stubs:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* doc/file.n:
	* various platform-specific 'TclpLoadFile': fixed comments about
	unload behaviour, and completed objectification of loading. Required
	change to Tcl_Filesystem lookup table, so incompatible with 8.4a3, but
	not older versions of Tcl. The change also allows 'link' and
	'reporting' filesystems to function correctly when loading files.
	Implementation of 'file delete -force' copes with case where cwd is
	inside the directory. Moved overlooked Tcl_FSGetPathType from internal
	to external API. Made sure filesystems which are registered and then
	unregistered are only freed when all references to them are gone.
	Documented changes.
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: when deleting directories recursively, make sure
	permissions are ok. Together with the above, this fixes [Bug 219139]
	* tests/winFCmd.test: differentiated test results for win2k versus
	not. This fixes [Bug: 219239]
	* tests/fCmd.test: added tests for 'file delete -force' where the cwd
	is inside, and when permissions are inadequate.

2001-09-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: fixed incorrect operands for INST_LIST [Bug
	458241] (David Cuthbert, dacut@users.sourceforge.net)

2001-09-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): fixed missing comma in
	debug macro.

2001-09-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/ExprLongObj.3: Fixed error in documentation of argument type to
	Tcl_ExprObj [Bug 457435]

2001-09-02  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Portability fix for Cygwin who's c-runtime,
	not surprisingly, doesn't have the MSVCRT specific _beginthreadex /
	_endthreadex pair. This might have to be revisited for proper Borland,
	lcc32, Watcom and other support as well. [Patch 444255]

	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Moved FinalizeConditionEvent() proto to within
	the main #ifdef TCL_THREADS block to avoid mingw warning about it
	being there but unused.

	* win/makefile.vc:  Added -Zl (zee el) to tclStubLib.c compile line to
	make sure the tclstub84.lib static library is built without requiring
	a specific C-runtime library at link-time for the end-use developer.
	It has been noted on c.l.t that this trips many first time users
	trying to make extensions. [Patch 403533]

2001-08-31  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: added TclCompileListCmd header
	* generic/tclBasic.c: added TclCompileListCmd compile proc
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileListCmd): function to compile the
	'list' command at parse time.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): definition of INST_LIST
	bytecode.

	* doc/StringObj.3: added words of warning to use Tcl_ResetResult with
	the Tcl_Append* functions.

	* tests/compile.test: added compile-11.* interp result checks
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): added Tcl_ResetResult before
	Tcl_AppendStringsToObj to prevent shared object crash when called from
	bcc instruction. The Tcl_Append* calls that append to the result
	object that are invoked by bcc insts must remember to call
	Tcl_ResetResult because the bcc doesn't do this for us. [Bug 456892]

2001-08-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c: fixed some casting problems that upset Crays.
	[Bug 419528] (andreasen)

2001-08-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Silence warning from Sun compiler. [Bug 454374]

2001-08-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: allow cached fully-qualified command names to
	be usable from different namespaces within the same interpreter
	without forcing a new lookup. This speeds up scripts that pass command
	names in variables ("this" in some OO packages). [Patch 456668]

2001-08-30 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Further fs updates. After examining the most common Tcl extensions
	(TclX, BLT, Tk, TclPro, Mktclapp), it has been determined that only
	TclpGetCwd and the Access/Stat/Open insert/delete hooks of the
	internal fs functions are ever used. The remaining functions from
	Tcl's internal interfaces have therefore been removed, since Tcl now
	exports a more suitable public API (Tcl_FS...)

	* generic/tclInt.stubs:
	* generic/tclInt.h: updated for removed internal functions. Some new
	internal functions have been put in tclInt.h (and not exported in the
	stub table because good public equivalents exist).
	* generic/tclTest.c: some test functions used the internal private
	APIs. These tests have been retained, but modified to use public APIs.
	Also objectified the internal filesystem tests.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: removed TclpStat, TclpAccess and refactored code
	to use NativeAccess, NativeStat. This should speed up stat, access and
	glob commands.
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: removed all TclpCopy/Rename/Delete File/Directory
	string-based procedures which aren't used any more. Improved
	efficiency of some other procedures. Ensure that filename conversions
	with a NULL interp do not crash Tcl.
	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: wrapped long lines and cleaned up
	TclpObjNormalizePath, removed all TclpCopy/Rename/Delete
	File/Directory string-based procedures which aren't used any more.
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: removed obsolete TclpStat, TclpAccess, TclpChdir,
	etc.
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: removed use of TclpAccess, removed all
	TclpCopy/Rename/Delete File/Directory string-based procedures which
	aren't used any more.
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: removed obsolete TclpStat, TclpAccess,
	TclpChdir, etc.
	* tcl(Unix|Mac|Win)Chan.c: objectified TclpOpenFileChannel.
	* various 'load' implementations all objectified.
	* generic/tclFileName.c: removed redundant code.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: removed TclStat, TclAccess, TclpListVolumes.
	Fix to MatchInDirectory at the root of a volume. Also improved some
	documentation, and improved default path joining behaviour for virtual
	filesystems, especially regarding '~'.
	* tests/fileName.test: added tests to check for bugs fixed above.
	* doc/FileName.3: improved documentation

2001-08-30  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclAsync.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: Improper cleanup of asyncMutex in tclAsync.c
	repaired. TclFinalizeSynchronization() was trying to remove a
	registered mutex that was dumped earlier when the TSD it was stored in
	was cleared. This was only surfacing on *nix. Windows was being masked
	by mutexes not actually being returned to the system! That was
	repaired in a previous patch. Needed to add a private
	TclFinalizeAsync() to tclAsync.c and called from Tcl_FinalizeThread().
	Pheww.. Is this done yet? [Bug 414419] requested by Rob Ratcliff
	<rrr6399@futuretek.com>

2001-08-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclPushVarName): noted 'static' defn.
	[Bug 453872]

2001-08-26  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl (tcl_findLibrary):
	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.{1,9}):
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Corrected inconsistency
	between  the search path for script libraries and the directory name
	$DISTNAME into which distributions built by 'make test' unpack. [Bug
	455642]

2001-08-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/stringComp.test: added string-1.3
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): changed to return
	TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE instead of TCL_ERROR when compiling and an
	unknown string method is called. This is necessary as the string
	command may be never called, or not until 'string' is redefined.

2001-08-24 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/glob.n: documented windows-style path issue with glob.
	[Bug 219392]
	* doc/filename.n: documented windows path/file length limitation.
	[Bug 454597]

2001-08-24  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.9): Corrected expected result to
	match Tcl's quirky construction of its init library path.

2001-08-23  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Fixed [Bug 432499]. Part of the
	code used the non-absolute path to the executable to determine
	quoting. This failed if the absolute path contained spaces, but the
	application name itself not. This bug caused no trouble on Win NT 5,
	but does for other variants in the Win* family. Report and fix due to
	Ken Poole <kenpoole@users.sourceforge.net>.

2001-08-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added QNX-6 build support. [Bug 219410] (loverso)

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclFileName.c: corrected minor compiler warnings.

2001-08-23 Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Variety of small filesystem and vfs issues fixed or improved. The new
	fs code allows many new opportunities for efficiency improvements
	through the objectified API. The main changes integrated here are such
	efficiency improvements. Some limitations of the original
	implementation have also now been lifted. Meanwhile a variety of fs
	bugs (some old, some new) have also been fixed.

	* generic/tclFileName.c: Made Tcl_FSSplitPath more efficient, and
	removed some static string-based procedures which are no longer used.
	Much more objectification. Tcl_FSJoinPath is now very efficient and
	more aware of virtual filesystems. Clarified where the Mac-specific
	code attempts to interpret Unix-style paths. Modified TclDoGlob to use
	lstat not access to fix [Bug 434876] (L. Virden)

	* tcl(Win|Unix|Mac)FCmd.c:
	* tcl(Win|Unix|Mac)File.c: replaced TclpListVolumes with
	TclpObjListVolumes with different signature, updated code due to more
	efficient signature of Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath. Used cached native
	paths where possible to improve efficiency -- this was completed on
	MacOS, but on Unix and Win the traversal functions make the task much
	more complex, so there are still some improvements possible there.
	Removed unused TclpNormalizePath which had been left in tclWinFCmd.c.
	Objectified all 'file attributes' functions. Fixed the new [Bug
	451571, Bruce Stephens] which is most obvious on Unix, but could occur
	on MacOS or Windows. This bug actually existed in Tcl 8.3.x but was
	only made obvious by the recent filesystem overhaul when the code was
	exercised more heavily.
	* tests/fileName.test: Three new tests to exercise the above bug, and
	make sure it is fixed correctly.
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: avoid panic in glob when a link doesn't point
	anywhere. It would probably be good to define exactly what Tcl should
	do in circumstances like these, and make sure mac/win/unix all behave
	accordingly. [Bug 417111] (Hemang Lavana). Also fixed
	misleading/obsolete comment in the code.
	* generic/tcl.stubs: changed signature of Tcl_FSGetTranslatedPath and
	added Tcl_FSGetTranslatedStringPath.
	These changes allow further optimisations in the FS code.
	* generic/tcl.h: changed signature of Tcl_FSListVolumes so that it
	doesn't require a Tcl interpreter plus result. Renamed Tcl_FSReadLink
	to Tcl_FSLink with additional argument so we can support making links
	in the future. [Patch: 450340]
	* generic/tclInt.h: added declaration for TclpObjListVolumes.
	Objectified internal call signatures for 'file attributes' functions,
	and added an internal objectified get path type function.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: added the moved function TclpListVolumes which
	calls platform specific code (needed for backwards compatibility), and
	improved efficiency of parts of the FS (particularly file
	normalization). Much less copying and memory allocation is required
	now. added new GetPathType so that changes in 'file volumes' can
	actually affect files' types, and objectified more code. Made current
	code work with test suite artificially changing current platform.
	Added 'static' keywords where required.
	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c: Added 'static' keywords, fixing [Bug 453872] (Bob
	Techentin)
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: file command implementation updated for API
	changes, removed unnecessary special-case SplitPath static function,
	since it no longer helps prevent code duplication. Moved setting of
	interpreter result to each individual location that actually required
	it, to avoid very large code separation between reading and setting
	the result.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: updated documentation for the new or changed APIs,
	and clarified some issues.
	* doc/SplitPath.3: added pointer to newer APIs in FileSystem.3
	* doc/filename.n: clarified current implementation of tilde support on
	Mac/Win.  [Bug 453514] (Sergey Kuzmin)
	* doc/glob.n: improved documentation for '-directory' and '-path'
	options.

	There are now many private, obsolete, platform-specific 'Tclp'
	string-based filesystem APIs which could be removed. We should check
	whether any of these are used by extensions and, at least in Tcl 9,
	remove them.

	The above changes signify a ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** with
	8.4a3, since signatures of two functions in the new API have changed,
	but not with older versions of Tcl.

2001-08-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (FormatNumber): Extract a long from the object
	and not an int, to stop [binary format] from being unable to format
	some input numbers on architectures where sizeof(int) is less than
	sizeof(long) (particularly Alpha). [tiprender Bug 441861]

	* tests/format.test: Converted conditional execution of tests into a
	test constraint.

2001-08-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/makefile.vc: updated install target for dde1.2
	* doc/dde.n: fixed dde man page (which was totally incorrect).
	* tests/winDde.test:
	* win/tclWinDde.c (Tcl_DdeObjCmd): added -binary option to dde request
	command to allow for returning binary data. [Bug 227482]
	Updated dde to 1.2

	* tests/tcltest.test: added unixExecs constraint to files that used
	'grep' in the test. [Bug 453143]

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: fixed stdio constraint test. [Patch
	454050] (stanton)
	Simplified unixExecs constraint test.

2001-08-22  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioUtil.test (ioUtil-3.*): Corrected errors in tests revealed
	by fix of overagressive compiler. [Bug 451200]

2001-08-21  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* tests/compile.test: Fixed overagressive compilation of [catch]: it
	was catching errors at substitution time. [Bug 219184]

2001-08-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test (tcltest-12.2): fixed test that would break when
	env vars weren't Tcl list friendly [Patch 454046] (stanton)

2001-08-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): added port number to Host: header to
	comply with HTTP/1.1 spec (RFC 2068). [Bug 452217]

2001-08-16  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* tools/tcl.hpj.in:
	* win/tcl.hpj.in:  Removed -kb storage in CVS to ensure these text
	files are checked-out in the translation mode CVS is in. Setting these
	as binary as part of an effort to make sure they are always in CRLF,
	no matter what the CVS translation, is bypassing how CVS works and is
	confusing.

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:  Removed LF-only output. Having to reconvert
	back to CRLF before committing to CVS was giving me a headache. [Bug
	451333]

	* win/makefile.vc: replaced $(WINDIR) with $(include32) for the
	.rc.res inference rule. winver.h wasn't getting included. [Bug 445630]

2001-08-14  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: make the intial maxNestingDepth of an
	interpreter be MAX_NESTING_DEPTH instead of a hardwired value. [Bug
	232564]

2001-08-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/trace.test: Corrected test numbers. [Bug 449794]

2001-08-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4: Use GCC variable set by AC_PROG_CC instead of defining
	our own using_gcc variable.

2001-08-11  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Variety of small issues introduced by the vfs code fixed:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: uninitialised read.
	* generic/tclFCmd.c: possible memory leak in file delete with error
	condition.

2001-08-10  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/trace.test: Insure that [array] traces work correctly for
	undefined variables. [Bug 449094]

2001-08-09  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Delete the unused getcwd.o target. [Bug 440942]

	will be an 8.4a4 release. [Bug 448938]

2001-08-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	8.4a3 RELEASE

	* changes:
	* README:
	* mac/README:
	* unix/README:
	* win/README.binary: updated for 8.4a3 release

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_FSSplitPath): update to Tcl style guide.

	* generic/tclFCmd.c (FileCopyRename): fixed mem leak in introduction
	of vfs code where a new Tcl_Obj wasn't freed.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd, Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): reordered
	the retrieval of arguments to avoid shimmering bug when the pattern
	and string referenced the same object.

	* unix/configure: regenerated
	* unixE/tcl.m4: added GNU (HURD) configuration target.
	[Patch 442974] (brinkmann)

	* win/README: made note of URL for Windows compilation notes

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpFinalizeMutex, TclpFinalizeCondition): added
	DeleteCriticalSection calls for cleanup [Patch 419683]

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateTempFile): fixed use of tmpnam,
	which is dangerous. [Patch 442636] (lim)
	The use of tmpnam in TclpTempFileName must still be changed.

	* tests/http.test (http-4.14): fixed variable error return.
	[Bug 424252]

2001-08-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure: regenerated
	* win/tcl.m4: fixed DLLSUFFIX definition to always be ${DBGX}.dll.
	This is necessary for TEA compliant builds that build shared against a
	static-built Tcl.
	* win/Makefile.in ($(TCLSH)): added $(TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE) to build
	target, otherwise it wouldn't get generated in a static build.

2001-08-06  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Applied patch from [Bug 442665]
	to fix the bug reported by it. The function can corrupt a freed object
	if it is called with objc == 3. This is because it retrieves resultPtr
	and does not increment its reference count, but then calls
	Tcl_ObjSetVar2, which causes the retrieved resultPtr object to be
	released.

2001-08-06  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tclsh.1: Added note that the tclsh program is frequently
	installed with the Tcl version numer as part of the name. [Patch
	402725]

	* generic/tclPkg.c:
	* tests/pkg.test:  [package forget] now forgets all of the package
	arguments it receives, not stopping when a package is not found. [Bug
	415273]

2001-08-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory): corrected
	uninitialized value.

2001-08-02  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Revert <tchar.h> related changes made to improve
	Cygwin support on 2001-07-18. This change ended up breaking the VC++
	build because of conflicts between Windows APIs and internal Tk APIs.

2001-08-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: minor casts to eliminate warnings. (lim)
	[Patch 440218]

	* tests/parseOld.test: changed some tests that required testwordend to
	exist to skip in a proper tcltest manner. [Bug 442663]

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::mapReply): the regsub'ing of \n and \t
	to escape them was unnecessary.

2001-07-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (Tcl_CreateThread): Close Windows HANDLE returned
	by _beginthreadex. The MS documentation states that this handle is not
	closed by a later call to _endthreadex.

2001-07-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/pkgMkindex.n:
	* library/package.tcl:  Corrected documentation and usage message of
	[pkg_mkIndex].

2001-07-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: Define TCHAR by including windows.h instead
	of tchar.h since Cygwin does not support the tchar.h header. Include
	CHECK_UNICODE_CALLS logic from tclWinPort.h.
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Remove CHECK_UNICODE_CALLS logic. Remove include
	of windows.h since this now done it tclPlatDecls.h.
	* win/tclWinReg.c: Remove duplicate include of windows.h.

2001-07-18  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Aftermath to [Bug 427196]. Squash empty buffers if
	they are smaller than the requested buffersize, to prevent reusage of
	old buffers and to honor changes in the requested buffersize made by
	the user.

2001-07-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpReadlink): Add Cygwin specific definition for
	the TclpReadlink function. This method implements reading of symbolic
	links when build with Cygwin.

2001-07-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Add Cygwin specific defines for environ and
	timezone variables.

2001-07-17  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (GetInput): Fixed [Bug 427196]. Memory was
	overwritten because a buffer was used after a change of the requested
	buffersize together with that requested buffersize and not its actual
	size, which was smaller. Note that the continous reuse of the smaller
	buffer negatively impacts performance. The system never allocates a
	buffer with the newly requested bigger buffersize.

2001-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* generic/tcl.h: Define __WIN32__ when __CYGWIN__ or __MINGW32__ is
	defined.
	* generic/tclAlloc.c: Define caddr_t when compiling with VC++ or
	mingw. This type is already defined when compiling with Cygwin.

2001-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:
	Remove unnecessary #includes of dos.h, direct.h, and tchar.h. This
	will help the Cygwin porting effort since these headers do not exist
	under Cygwin.

2001-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (PipeClose2Proc): constrained the mutex lock to
	just the TerminateThread call and waiting for termination. (jsmith)

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: Removed extra copy of the SCAN_* macros
	#defined in generic/tclScan.c. [Bug 441230] (porter)

2001-07-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8): Added extra constraint,
	notInstalledInTmp, to stop this test from damaging installations in
	/tmp; not much fun to have to reinstall the Tcl library every time you
	run the test suite!

	* tests/subst.test (subst-10.*): Updated tests to check new behaviour
	for 'break' in command substitutions.
	(subst-1.2,subst-7.1): Error messages changed.
	* doc/SubstObj.3: New file, to document Tcl_SubstObj.
	* doc/subst.n: Improved and updated documentation for 'subst' to help
	support the changed behaviour.
	* generic/tcl.decls (generic-437): Declaration for Tcl_SubstObj
	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_SUBST_*): Added flags for Tcl_SubstObj.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj,Tcl_SubstObjCmd): Divided into two
	parts to allow people to access the innards of 'subst' and changed the
	behaviour when command substitutions do a 'break' to be different from
	'continue'. Also now works with objects, which allows for some nifty
	optimisations with variable substitutions and a slight improvement
	with command substitutions. [TIP#36]

2001-07-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add AR variable for use in STLIB_LD.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Use STLIB_LD when defining MAKE_LIB and
	MAKE_STUB_LIB. Subst RANLIB and AR.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add doc comment about STLIB_LD
	command. Check ${AR} env var when setting STLIB_LD and delay
	evaluation until make time.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Delay evaluation of ${AR} in STLIB_LD
	and add flags to better match the Unix implementation. Don't bother
	defining AR when using VC++ since it is not used.

2001-07-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Pass -e _WinMain@16 in addition to
	the -mwindows flag to work around a problem with ld when it
	incorrectly use main() as the executable entry point when both
	WinMain() and main() are available.

2001-07-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Added leading zero to file modes to work around
	fault in HPUX strtol() which ignores the base parameter. [Bug 438808]

2001-07-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Subst DEPARG directly instead of relying on a
	variable. This will make Cygwin builds faster since an extra exec will
	be avoided.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Subst DEPARG.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Move AC_MSG_CHECKING after the
	AC_CHECK_PROG so that status messages do not get mixed together. Set
	DEPARG based on the results of the cygpath check so that we avoid
	using an extra exec when it is not needed. Use ac_cv_cygwin status
	flag instead of looking at the output of gcc -v, which works in the
	case where -mno-cygwin is set in the CFLAGS.

2001-07-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:
	* mac/README:
	* unix/README:
	* win/README:
	* win/README.binary: updated READMEs with purls

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Remove PATHTYPE variable.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't subst PATHTYPE.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Remove PATHTYPE variable. Set CYGPATH
	to "cygpath -w" if the cygpath executable is found on the path. This
	approach works for native Cygwin builds and cross compiles.

2001-07-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/var.test:
	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_VariableObjCmd): added patch to check for
	number of args. [Patch 426038]

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_GetVar2Ex): added ability to recognize
	TCL_TRACE_READS flags to cause creation of part1 in TclLookupVar to
	make sure newly created array will get read traces triggered
	appropriately. This is called by Tcl_ObjGetVar2, Tcl_GetVar, and
	Tcl_GetVar2.
	(TclSetIndexedScalar, TclSetElementOfIndexedArray): added read trace
	triggering for lappend case.
	(Tcl_LappendObjCmd): pass TCL_TRACE_READS to Tcl_ObjGetVar2 to trigger
	possible read traces for new arrays.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): added TCL_TRACE_READS
	flag to INST_LAPPEND(_ARRAY)_STK case to trigger read traces for newly
	created arrays. Removed unnecessary #ifdef for TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG in
	INST_LOAD_SCALAR1 case.

	* tests/append.test:
	* tests/appendComp.test: added tests for read trace triggering for
	append and lappend.

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.test (clock-2.5): Adjust test so that it passes when the
	time slice is 60 msecs, now passes under Windows 98.

2001-07-03  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't pass the v flag to ${AR} when
	using gcc, verbose output is not needed.

2001-07-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8):  Changed test back to using
	installation layout, adding comments explaining why the test writes to
	the directories it does, and checks to avoid destroying other files in
	/tmp.

2001-07-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-1.2): Fixed faults reported in
	[Bug 438070] - well, at least enough to work on Solaris - and added
	comments that should make what is going on in the test clearer.

2001-07-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/util.test: added util-4.6
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_ConcatObj): Corrected walking backwards over
	utf-8 chars. [Bug 227512]

2001-07-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.8):  Corrected test for all absolute
	pathnames in library path when executable is installed near root
	directory to use correct development directory layout. [Bug 438014]

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.9):
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Corrected buggy
	construction of search path entries relative to executable. Added test
	for bad construction. [Bug 438014]

2001-06-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: Correction to faulty patch from [Bug 231259]

2001-06-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-1.2): Modified so as not to require a
	local echo service, which fails on many systems which have that turned
	off for security reasons...

2001-06-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in: added a -DPURIFY mode that makes Tcl_Obj's
	allocated and free singularly (instead of in alloc in blocks and never
	free) to allow checkers like Purify to operate better.

	* library/encoding/koi8-u.enc: added koi8-u (Ukranian variant)
	encoding.

	* tests/subst.test:
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfBackslash): Corrected backslash handling of
	multibyte utf-8 chars. [Bug 217987]

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoProcsCmd): fixed potential mem leak in info
	procs that created objects without using them.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): fixed mem leak when
	string command failed to parse the subcommand.

	* doc/interp.n:
	* doc/unknown.n: updated notes about what is in a safe interp. [Bug
	218605]

2001-06-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/event.test (event-11.5): Removed hard-coded port number which
	could fail on some systems. [Bug 436727]

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Add `make shell` target. This target will set the
	proper env vars before invoking tclsh from the build directory.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/Makefile.in: Use : to separate VPATH entries. This works for
	both Cygwin builds and cross builds, the VPSEP variable is simply
	unneeded complexity.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't subst VPSEP.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Remove VPSEP variable.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Fix last checkin by removing export since that
	only works in bash.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Ditto.

2001-06-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Set CFLAGS to "" if the user did not set CFLAGS
	in the env. This keeps AC_PROG_CC from adding "-g -O2" to the CFLAGS
	by default.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Ditto.

2001-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Use RC_DEFINE flag from tcl.m4.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Set RC_DEFINE flag based on the
	compiler in use.

2001-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Link to the imm32 library when
	building with mingw gcc.

2001-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): When building with gcc, don't attempt
	to link with LD or support dllwrap. Simply require a recent version of
	Cygwin gcc or Mingw gcc that supports -shared. When linking, use gcc
	instead of ld since gcc automatically includes libs like -lmsvcrt.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add resource compiler fix from 8.3.3 to fix
	compiling with mingw.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4: Fix silly typo in last checkin.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@. Set
	LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@. Add LDFLAGS_DEBUG and
	LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to match the way CFLAGS_DEFAULT works. This will
	support user set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS at configure time.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS to CFLAGS_DEFAULT, instead
	subst CFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile. Add AC_SUBST for
	CFLAGS_DEFAULT, LDFLAGS_DEFAULT, LDFLAGS_DEBUG, and LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS): Modify LDFLAGS_DEFAULT so that it
	uses a Makefile variable just like CFLAGS_DEFAULT.
	* win/Makefile.in: Set CFLAGS to @CFLAGS@ and @CFLAGS_DEFAULT@. Set
	LDFLAGS to @LDFLAGS@ and @LDFLAGS_DEFAULT@. This will support user set
	CFLAGS or LDFLAGS at configure time.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Don't set CFLAGS or LDFLAGS, instead subst
	CFLAGS_DEFAULT and LDFLAGS_DEFAULT into the Makefile.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS): Modify LDFLAGS_DEFAULT so that it
	uses a Makefile variable just like CFLAGS_DEFAULT.

2001-06-22  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Don't set LDFLAGS_DEBUG to -g or
	LDFLAGS_OPTIMIZE to -O when compiling with gcc. These flags are not
	needed and can cause problems with the Cygwin version of ld.

2001-06-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-1.2,unixInit-2.8): Added test for code
	described below, and fixed a couple of errors that caused problems
	during testing; the code to determine the installedTcl constraint was
	wrong, and test unixInit-2.8 assumed that /tmp/lib was free for use
	and could be deleted, which clashed nastily with my installation and
	made other tests fail unnecessarily!

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtyInit,TclpOpenFileChannel,
	(Tcl_MakeFileChannel,TclpGetDefaultStdChannel): Alterations so that
	the standard channels - stdin, stdout and stderr - have the correct
	type and fconfigure options. This required making the initialisation
	of serial lines a little more sophisticated to make the console behave
	correctly in interactive mode... [Bug 219137 and duplicates]

	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c (TclpPanic):
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Replaced TclMacSetPanic with TclpPanic for setting
	a platform-specific panic handler. TclpPanic is NULL on Unix and
	Windows. Fixes broken wish on Mac due to earlier patches. [Patch
	415648]

	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: `make gentubs` after above changes.

	[Patch 415648, TIP 27]

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* mac/tclMacAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacBOAAppInit.c (main):
	* mac/tclMacPanic.c: Modified special Mac implementations of
	Tcl_*Panic* to be exact copies of the generic implementations. Added
	TclMacSetPanic. The generic implementations should be used directly,
	rather than copies, but that requires further changes by someone
	familiar with the Mac build systems. [Patch 415648]

	Unicode v3.1.0 compliance.
	* generic/tclUniData.c: regenerated from Unicode v3.1.0 data file (new
	as of 2001-05-16). This brings Tcl to current unicode compliance.

	* tools/uniClass.tcl: added comments to output format and the script
	for clarification.

	* tools/uniParse.tcl: corrected filename output and GetDelta macro to
	use 'info' as param (was 'infO')

2001-05-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

2001-05-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG): Fix comments, and typo in cached
	variable name.

2001-05-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TKCONFIG): Remove use of undefined TCLCONFIG
	variable and call AC_MSG_RESULT to print the checking result.
	* win/tcl.m4: Ditto.

2001-05-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclObj.c (TclAllocateFreeObjects): simplified

2001-05-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: removed Tcl_DuplicateObj in INST_DUP

2001-05-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/tcltest.test (tcltest-19.1): fixed failing test that was
	getting affected by Windows env handling of empty valued elements.

	* unix/tcl.m4: added more common install directories in which to
	search for *Config.sh. [Bug 419812]

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-1.4): added notLinux constraint to test to
	prevent failure message on Linux due to OS caching bug.

	string.

	* tests/http.test: removed unused notLinux constraint setting

	* generic/tclRegexp.c (Tcl_RegExpExecObj): added use of
	Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj.

2001-05-19  Andreas Kupries <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* Note that "tclbench" (see project "tcllib") was extended with
	performance benchmarks for [fcopy] too.

	* doc/fcopy.n: Updated to reflect the extended behaviour of 'fcopy'.

	* tests/io.test: Added tests 'io-52.9', 'io-52.10' and 'io-52.11' to
	test the handling of encodings by 'fcopy' / 'TclCopychannel'. [Bug
	209210]

	* generic/tclIO.c: Split of both 'Tcl_ReadChars' and 'Tcl_WriteChars'
	into a public error checking and an internal working part. The public
	functions now use the new internal ones. The new functions are
	'DoReadChars' and 'DoWriteChars'. Extended 'CopyData' to use the new
	functions 'DoXChars' when required by the encodings on the input and
	output channels. [Bug 209210]

2001-05-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/history.tcl (tcl::HistAdd): prevent empty calls from being
	added to the history (arndt)

	* tests/error.test: updated error-1.3 message to account for string
	index being compiled at toplevel.
	* tests/appendComp.test:
	* tests/stringComp.test: new files for extended bytecode testing

	* generic/tclBasic.c: added new CompileProc invocations to basic
	command initialization.
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: added new compile commands for append,
	lappend, lindex and llength. Refactored set and incr compile commands
	to use new TclPushVarName function for handling the varname component
	during compilation (also used by append and lappend). Changed string
	compile command to compile toplevel code as well (when possible).
	* generic/tclCompile.c: added new instruction enums
	* generic/tclCompile.h: added debug info for new instructions
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): moved elemPtr to toplevel
	var (oft-used). Added definitions for new bytecode instructions
	INST_LIST_INDEX, INST_LIST_LENGTH, INST_APPEND_SCALAR1,
	INST_APPEND_SCALAR4, INST_APPEND_ARRAY1, INST_APPEND_ARRAY4,
	INST_APPEND_ARRAY_STK, INST_APPEND_STK, INST_LAPPEND_SCALAR1,
	INST_LAPPEND_SCALAR4, INST_LAPPEND_ARRAY1, INST_LAPPEND_ARRAY4,
	INST_LAPPEND_ARRAY_STK, INST_LAPPEND_STK.
	Refactored repititious code for reuse with INST_LOAD_STK (same as
	INST_LOAD_SCALAR_STK), INST_STORE_STK (same as INST_STORE_SCALAR_STK).
	Updated INST_STR_CMP with style of fix of 2001-04-06 Fellows
	[Bug 219201] as that fix only affected the runtime eval'ed "string"
	(string compare is normally byte-compiled now). We may want to back
	these out for speed in the future, noting the problems with \x00
	comparisons in the docs.
	* generic/tclInt.h: declarations for new compile commands.
	* generic/tclVar.c: change TclGetIndexedScalar,
	TclGetElementOfIndexedArray, TclSetElementOfIndexedArray and
	TclSetIndexedScalar to use flags. The Set functions now support
	TCL_APPEND_ELEMENT and TCL_LIST_ELEMENT as well.
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: minor signature changes for above.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: made use of new Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj.

2001-05-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/console.n: Deleted. Put it in the wrong source tree! D'oh!

2001-05-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetUnicodeFromObj): new function to
	parallel Tcl_GetStringFromObj (fix of an API oversight).

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: updated pipeChannelType to TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_2
	type specification.

	* tests/fileName.test: corrected tests not to fail on win when a
	C:/test dir exists.

	* generic/tclFileName.c (ExtractWinRoot): corrected ABR error

2001-05-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: invalidate all bytecodes in a namespace if a
	new command shadows a bytecoded command.
	* tests/namespace.test:
	Patched from [Bug 231259]

2001-05-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/console.n: Created. It seems very odd to me that the console
	implementation is part of the Tcl distribution and not part of Tk, but
	given the location of the source, the documentation must obviously
	match up...

2001-05-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd):
	* tests/string.test (string-4.14): Negative string indices should not
	be added as offsets to the result of [string first] but instead be
	treated as referring to the start of the string. [Bug 423581]

2001-05-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Add a LDFLAGS variable to the Makefile instead of
	directly substing @LDFLAGS@.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: Fix CFLAGS_DEFAULT so that the name of a Makefile
	variable is passed as @CFLAGS@.
	* win/Makefile.in: Move the setting of CFLAGS higher up in the
	Makefile.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Use dnl to comment out macros so that they are not

2001-05-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/library.n:
	* library/init.tcl:
	* tests/autoMkindex.t*: Modified [auto_import] to apply pattern
	matching in the [namespace import] style. [Bug 420186]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for any callers of [auto_import] from
	outside Tcl that expect the pattern matching to be like that of
	[string match].

2001-05-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c:
	* tests/namespace.test: Insure consistent behaviour of the [unknown]
	command: when a command is unknown, it is always processed by
	[::unknown], ignoring any namespace proc which happens to be called
	"unknown" [Patch 421166, Bug 420507]

2001-05-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: Add a package require of Tcl 8 at the beginning
	of the script so that the script will print a descriptive error
	message when run in an old Tcl 7 shell.

2001-04-27  Kevin Kenny	<kennykb@crd.ge.com>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Use $@ in MAKE_LIB and MAKE_STUB_LIB commands
	instead of using a delayed subst variable. Replace instances of
	STUB_LIB_FILE with TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE.

2001-04-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Use TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE instead of STUB_LIB_FILE.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't subst STUB_LIB_FILE, use TCL_STUB_LIB_FILE
	instead.

2001-04-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tools/encoding/iso8859-15.txt:
	* library/encoding/iso8859-15.enc: Oops! Got the full encoding wrong.
	Should be fixed now...

	* tools/encoding/iso8859-15.txt:
	* library/encoding/iso8859-15.enc:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in: Added ISO 8859-15 (a.k.a. Latin-1 + Euro currency
	symbol) support.

	415179]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** from 8.4a2, in which Vince Darley's
	changes to command tracing were added. A const has been added to the
	type signature of one of the parameters to Tcl_CommandTraceProc.

2001-04-10  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Altered code to use memcpy instead of
	structure assigments in an effort to achieve better K&R
	compatibility.

2001-04-10  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Fixed silly typo in calls to 'gmtime' and
	'localtime' that broke the Linux build.

2001-04-09  Kevin B. Kenny    <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c: Added DYNAMIC_PATH to the load flags so that the

	* unix/tcl.m4: Added _REENTRANT to Solaris build so that thread safe
	library routines are included.
	* unix/configure: Re-ran 'autoconf' with changed tcl.m4
	* tclUnixTime.c: Modified for thread safety of 'gmtime' and
	'localtime' system calls. [Bugs 219136 and 232558]

2001-04-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/expr.test (expr-21.*): Tests to check below fix.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (GetLexeme): Now recognises the
	non-numeric boolean literals for what they are. It no longer makes

	them, but this was true in 7.* as well [Bug 217777; finally!]

2001-04-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl:
	* tests/init.test:  Modified processing of $::errorInfo by [unknown]

	[Bug 219402]

	* tests/string.test (string-2.30): Test for this case
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd, STR_COMPARE branch): Fixed
	problem caused by Utf-rep of \x00 being more than Utf-rep of \x01
	fooling memcmp by forcing everything through Utf-based comparisons.
	Added optimizations for case where objects have a string/unicode-rep
	or a bytearray-rep (i.e. where we can perform comparisons on
	fixed-size units). [Bug 219201]
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UtfNcmp): Corrected seriously erroneous
	comment.

2001-04-05  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

2001-03-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* All of the changes below belong to TIP #10 [Tcl I/O Enhancement:
	Thread-Aware Channels]. See also [Patch 403358] at SF.

	* generic/tclIO.h (struct ChannelState, line 236f): Extended the
	structure with a new field of type 'Tcl_ThreadId' to hold the id of
	the thread currently managing all channels with this state.

	Note: This structure is shared by all channels in a stack of
	transformations.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_CreateChannel, lines 1058-1065): Modified to
	store the Id of the current thread in the 'ChannelState' of the new
	channel.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SpliceChannel, lines 2265-2270): Modified in
	the same manner as 'Tcl_CreateChannel' as the channel will be managed
	by the current thread afterward.

	* generic/tclIO.c   (Tcl_GetChannelThread, lines 1478-1503):
	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_GetChannelThread, lines 1504-1506): New API
	function to retrieve the Id of the managing thread from a channel.
	Implementation and declaration.

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestChannelCmd, lines 4520-4532): Added
	subcommand 'mthread' to query a channel about its managing thread.

2001-03-29  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@redhat.com>

	* tests/interp.test: Print out warning when testinterpdelete command
	is not defined. Add tests that checks to make sure a child interp
	inherits the parent's cwd.

2001-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@gimlet.activestate.com>

	* doc/tcltest.n: corrected incorrect macro usage.

	* doc/lsort.n: corrected unbalanced nroff macros.

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateTempFile): prevent potential race
	condition and security leak in tmp filename creation.
	[Patch 402924] (max)

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: corrected IRIX-5.x config to not use -n32.
	[Patch 403626] (english)

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (Tcl_ConditionWait): fixed handling of timeout
	for threads (corrects excessive CPU usage issue for Tk on Unix in
	threaded Tcl environment). [Bug 411603] (ruppert)

2001-03-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsort.n: Added some notes that clarify the behaviour of
	[lsort] as well as a whole bunch of examples.  [Bug 219202]

2001-03-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@gimlet.activestate.com>

	* doc/Alloc.3: corrected docs to note that Tcl_Attempt* return char
	*'s, not ints. [Bug 411388]

	* tests/regexp.test (regexp-19.1):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): fixed handling of nulls in
	subspec value.

2001-03-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclDecls.h (Tcl_InitCustomHashTable):  Correction to patch
	from 2001-01-18;  tclDecls.h was not generated using 'make genstubs'.

2001-03-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinInt.h (tclWinTCharEncoding): Removed as now a static
	variable in win/tclWin32Dll.c instead.

2001-03-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_ArrayObjCmd): Corrected retrieval of resultPtr
	to prevent possible corruption.

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_Import): Correctly freed a DString.
	[Patch 403755] (lavana)

2001-03-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/set-old.test (set-old-7.2): Changed error behaviour of
	[unset] to agree with documentation, so must change test as well.

2001-03-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl (pkg_mkIndex):  Added patch from Vince Darley to
	make [pkg_mkIndex -verbose] even more verbose. [Bug 219349, Patch
	403529]

2001-03-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/info.n: Improved documentation for [info hostname]. [Bug 403840]

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UnsetObjCmd): Made command behave as
	documented [issue remaining from Bug 405769]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): A missing {return TCL_OK;}
	was causing memory corruption. [Bug 408002]

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclDeleteExecEnv, GrowEvaluationStack,
	(TclExecuteByteCode): Added some casts to ClientData that are
	apparently needed on some architectures.

2001-03-12  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/string.test: Fixed some test numberings and added a test.
	[Patch 403229]

2001-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UnsetObjCmd): Rewrote argument parser to avoid
	a read off the end of the argument array that could occur when
	executing something like [unset -nocomplain] was executed. Improved
	the error message given when too few arguments are given (-nocomplain
	should obviously be *before* --, not after it) and also modified the
	test suite to take account of that and the documentation to use the
	same improvement. [Bug 405769]

2001-03-02  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed bug that could pass
	pointers to freed memory to command implementations, which most
	obviously caused some weird behaviour with [info level], but could
	have caused problems with user code and command traces too. [Bug
	404865, Patch 405436]

2001-02-23  msofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* no changes; fixing up the missing comment in the previous one.
	Sorry.

2001-02-23  msofer  <msofer@ant.utdt>

	* /cvsroot/tcl/tcl/tests/execute.test: added test for evaluation of an
	expression in a variable; evals once by compiling, second time using
	the previous compilation

2001-02-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/clock.n: Updated documentation to reflect the addition of
	compat/strftime.c, including the correct formatting of ISO-8601:1988
	fiscal week number (%V).

2001-02-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SplitObjCmd): Improved efficiency of
	splitting strings into individual characters by adding hash so that
	only one Tcl_Obj per character is created. Improves performance of
	splitting of short strings and makes a huge difference to splitting of
	long strings, such as is done in the mime package in tcllib. [Bug
	131523]

2001-01-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc (install-libraries):  Corrected misdirected install
	directory for the msgcat 1.2 package.

2001-01-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Moved code that updates the count of how
	many bytes are left to copy. Corrects bug that when writing occurs in
	the background, the copy loop could be escaped without updating the
	count, causing CopyData() to try to copy more bytes than the toRead
	value originally passed to TclCopyChannel(), leading to hangs and
	misreporting of number of bytes copied. [Bug 118203, Patch 103432]

2001-01-18  Andreas Kupries  <a.kupries@westend.com>

	Everything below belongs together, it fixes [Bug 123153]

	* generic/tcl.h (line 342): A bit more explanation about the default
	value for TCL_PRESERVE_BINARY_COMPATABILITY.

	* generic/tcl.h (line 1208): Define the macro 'Tcl_InitHashTable' only
	when TCL_PRESERVE_BINARY_COMPATIBILITY is not set as it kills binary
	compatibility to 8.3 and earlier versions. This is the main part of
	the patch/change.

	* generic/tcl.decls (line 1469):
	* generic/tclHash.c (Tcl_InitHashTable):
	* generic/tclHash.c (Tcl_InitHashTableEx):
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_InitObjHashTable): Changed
	'Tcl_InitHashTableEx' to 'Tcl_InitCustomHashTable'. This change is
	more of an estethical nature, replacing the ubiquitous 'Ex' suffix
	with a more meaningful name. The introduced binary incompatibility is
	deemed acceptable as it is between alpha versions.  Updated callers.

	* doc/Hash.3:
	* unix/mkLinks: Changed 'Tcl_InitHashTableEx' to
	'Tcl_InitCustomHashTable'.

2001-01-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/winPipe.test (winpipe-1.20):
	* tests/winDde.test (createChildProcess):
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test (pkgtest::createIndex): Removed assumption
	that paths contain no spaces which causes problems with both [eval]
	and [open |...] due to the well-known differences between lists and
	strings. Fixes [Bug 119406]

2001-01-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):  Several entries in the
	library path ($tcl_libPath) are determined relative to the absolute
	path of the executable. When the executable is installed in or near
	the root directory of the file system, relative pathnames were being
	incorrectly generated, and in the worst case, memory access violations
	were crashing the program. [Bug 119416, Patch 102972]
