.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The \fBtdbc::odbc\fR driver provides a database interface that conforms
to Tcl DataBase Connectivity (TDBC) and allows a Tcl script to connect
to any SQL database presenting an ODBC interface.  It is also provided
as a worked example of how to write a database driver in C, so that
driver authors have a starting point for further development.
.PP
Connection to an ODBC database is established by invoking
\fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR, passing it the name to be used
as a connection handle, followed by a standard ODBC
connection string. As an alternative, \fBtdbc::odbc::connection new\fR
may be used to create
a database connection with an automatically assigned name. The return value
from \fBtdbc::odbc::connection new\fR is the name that was chosen for the
connection handle.
.PP
The connection string will include at least a
\fBDRIVER\fR or \fBDSN\fR keyword, and may include others that are defined by a
particular ODBC driver. (If the local ODBC system supports a graphical
user interface, the \fB-parent\fR option (see below) may allow calling
\fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR with an empty connection string.)
.PP
The side effect of \fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR is to create a
new database connection.. See \fBtdbc::connection(n)\fR for the
details of how to use the connection to manipulate a database.
.PP
In addition to a standard TDBC interface, \fBtdbc::odbc\fR supports
three additional ccommands. The first of these,
\fBtdbc::odbc::datasources\fR, which returns a Tcl
list enumerating the named data sources available to the program (for
connection with the \fBDSN\fR keyword in the connection string).
The result of \fBtdbc::odbc::datasources\fR may be constrained to only
system data sources or only user data sources by including the
\fB-system\fR or \fB-user\fR options, respectively.
.PP
The \fBtdbc::odbc::drivers\fR command returns a dictionary whose keys
are the names of drivers available for the \fBDRIVER\fR keyword in the
connection string, and whose values are descriptions of the drivers.
.PP
The \fBtdbc::odbc::datasource\fR command allows configuration of named
data sources on those systems that support the ODBC Installer
application programming interface. It accepts a \fIcommand\fR, which
specifies the operation to be performed, the name of a \fIdriver\fR
for the database in question, and a set of keyword-value pairs that
are interpreted by the given driver. The \fIcommand\fR must be one of
the following:
.IP \fBadd\fR
Adds a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include
at least a \fBDSN\fR option naming the data source
.IP \fBadd_system\fR
Adds a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must include
at least a \fBDSN\fR option naming the data source
.IP \fBconfigure\fR
Configures a user data source. The keyword-value pairs will usually
include a \fBDSN\fR option naming the data source. Some drivers will
support other options, such as the \fBCREATE_DB\fR option to the
Microsoft Access driver on Windows.
.IP \fBconfigure_system\fR
Configures a system data source.
.IP \fBremove\fR
Removes a user data source. The keyword-value pairs must include a
\fBDSN\fR option specifying the data source to remove.
.IP \fBremove_system\fR
Removes a system data source. The keyword-value pairs must include a
\fBDSN\fR option specifying the data source to remove.
.SH "CONNECTION OPTIONS"
.PP
The \fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR object command supports the
\fB-encoding\fR, \fB-isolation\fR, \fB-readonly\fR and \fB-timeout\fR
options common to all TDBC drivers. The \fB-encoding\fR option will
succeed only if the requested encoding is the same as the system
encoding; \fBtdbc::odbc\fR does not attempt to specify alternative
encodings to an ODBC driver. (Some drivers accept encoding
specifications in the connection string.)
.PP
In addition, if Tk is present in the requesting interpreter,
and the local system's ODBC driver manager supports a graphical user
interface, the \fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR object command
supports a \fB-parent\fR option, whose value is the path name of
a Tk window. If this option is specified, and a connection string does
not specify all the information needed to connect to an interface, the
ODBC driver manager will display a dialog box to request whatever
additional information is required. The requesting interpreter will
block until the user dismisses the dialog, at which point the
connection is made.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Sincs ODBC connection strings are driver specific, it is often
difficult to find the documentation needed to compose them. The
following examples are known to work on most Windows systems and
provide at least a few useful things that a program can do.
.PP
.CS
tdbc::odbc::connection create db \\
    "DSN={PAYROLL};UID={aladdin};PWD={Sesame}"
.CE
Connects to a named data source "PAYROLL", providing "aladdin" as a
user name and "Sesame" as a password. Uses \fBdb\fR as the name of the
connection.
.PP
.CS
set connString {DRIVER={Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)};}
append connString {FIL={MS Access}\\;}
append connString {DBQ=} \\
    [file nativename [file normalize $fileName]]
tdbc::odbc::connection create db2 -readonly 1 $connString
.CE
Opens a connection to a Microsoft Access database file whose
name is in \fI$fileName\fR. The database is opened in read-only
mode. The resulting connection is called "db2".
.PP
.CS
tdbc::odbc::connection create db3 \\
    "DRIVER=SQLite3;DATABASE=$fileName"
.CE
Opens a connection to a SQLite3 database whose name is in "$fileName".
.PP
.CS
tdbc::odbc::datasource add \\
    {Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)} \\
    DSN=MyTestDatabase \\
    DBQ=[file native [file normalize $fileName]]
.CE
Creates a new user data source with the name, "MyTestDatabase" bound
to a Microsoft Access file whose path name is in "$fileName". No
connection is made to the data source until the program calls
\fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR.
.PP
.CS
tdbc::odbc::datasource configure \\
    {Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)} \\
    CREATE_DB=[file native [file normalize $fileName]] \\
    General
.CE
Creates a new, empty Microsoft Access database in the file identified
by "$fileName". No connection is made to the database until the
program calls \fBtdbc::odbc::connection create\fR.
