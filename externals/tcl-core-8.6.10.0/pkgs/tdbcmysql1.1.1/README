README: tdbcmysql

    This is the 1.1.1 source distribution of the driver for Tcl
    Database Connectivity (TDBC) to access MySQL databases.. TDBC and
    its drivers are available from a Fossil version control repository
    at http://tdbc.tcl.tk/

RCS: @(#) $Id: $

1. Introduction

This directory contains the source code, documentation, and test
scripts for the MySQL driver for Tcl Database Connectivity. This
module, plus TDBC itself, allow you to access MySQL databases using a
standard application programming interface (API) from a Tcl script.
This module is also available from http://tdbc.tcl.tk along with the
source code of TDBC itself. A bug database and Wiki are available at
the same location.

Tdbc::mysql is a freely-available open source package.  You can do
virtually anything you like with it, such as modifying it,
redistributing it, and selling it either in whole or in part.  See the
file "license.terms" for complete information.

2. Compilation and Installation

This module follows the general configuration and installation
rules described in the README file for tdbc. In addition to the
options described there, the 'configure' script for tdbcmysql
accepts the following two options:

    --with-mysql-includedir=PATH

	Specifies PATH as the path to the directory that contains
	'mysql.h' and related header files.

    --with-mysql-libdir=PATH

	Specifies PATH as the path to the directory that contains
	the MySQL link libraries.

Building on Windows is tested only with msys/mingw, and only with
the version of MySQL present in XAMPP (https://sourceforge.net/projects/xampp)
You need the 'xampp-win32-devel' package as well as the 'xampp-win32'
package.

In order to build the code under msys/mingw, you need to rebuild the
import library for use by mingw. (This also requires the 'reimp'
utility from mingw-utils.) The recipe for this step is:

    reimp -d drive:/path/to/xampp/lib/mysql/libmysql.lib
    dlltool -k -d libmysql.def -l libmysql.a
    cp libmysql.a drive:/path/to/mingw/lib

It is also convenient to make sure that the MySQL headers are available
without the --with option:

   cp -r drive:/path/to/xampp/include/mysql/* drive:/path/to/mingw/include/

Then an ordinary 'configure' and 'make' should function to build the
load module.

NOTE THAT ON WINDOWS, THE 'libmysql.dll' LIBRARY MUST BE ON THE PATH
AT RUNTIME.  Probably the easiest way to ensure this happens is to
put it either in the Windows 'system32' directory or the 'bin'
directory of your Tcl distribution.

3. Documentation

The 'doc' subdirectory in this release contains a set of reference
manual entries for tdbc::mysql.  Files with an extension '.n' are for
Tcl classes and commands; files with an extension '.3' are for C
library functions. The file, 'doc/tdbcmysql.n' gives an overview,
listing the classes and functions
