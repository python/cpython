.SH NAME
Tk_Init, Tk_SafeInit \- add Tk to an interpreter and make a new Tk application.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
int
\fBTk_Init\fR(\fIinterp\fR)
.sp
int
\fBTk_SafeInit\fR(\fIinterp\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter in which to load Tk.  Tk should not already be loaded
in this interpreter.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_Init\fR is the package initialization procedure for Tk.
It is normally invoked by the \fBTcl_AppInit\fR procedure
for an application or by the \fBload\fR command.
\fBTk_Init\fR adds all of Tk's commands to \fIinterp\fR
and creates a new Tk application, including its main window.
If the initialization is successful \fBTk_Init\fR returns
\fBTCL_OK\fR;  if there is an error it returns \fBTCL_ERROR\fR.
\fBTk_Init\fR also leaves a result or error message
in interpreter \fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
If there is a variable \fBargv\fR in \fIinterp\fR, \fBTk_Init\fR
treats the contents of this variable as a list of options for the
new Tk application.
The options may have any of the forms documented for the
\fBwish\fR application (in fact, \fBwish\fR uses Tk_Init to process
its command-line arguments).
.PP
\fBTk_SafeInit\fR is identical to \fBTk_Init\fR except that it removes
all Tk commands that are considered unsafe.  Those commands and the
reasons for their exclusion are:
.TP
\fBbell\fR
Continuous ringing of the bell is a nuisance.
.TP
\fBclipboard\fR
A malicious script could replace the contents of the clipboard with
the string
.QW "\fBrm \-r *\fR"
and lead to surprises when the contents of the clipboard are pasted.
.TP
\fBgrab\fR
Grab can be used to block the user from using any other applications.
.TP
\fBmenu\fR
Menus can be used to cover the entire screen and to steal input from
the user.
.TP
\fBselection\fR
See clipboard.
.TP
\fBsend\fR
Send can be used to cause unsafe interpreters to execute commands.
.TP
\fBtk\fR
The tk command recreates the send command, which is unsafe.
.TP
\fBtkwait\fR
Tkwait can block the containing process forever
.TP
\fBtoplevel\fR
Toplevels can be used to cover the entire screen and to steal input
from the user.
.TP
\fBwm\fR
If toplevels are ever allowed, wm can be used to remove decorations,
move windows around, etc.
