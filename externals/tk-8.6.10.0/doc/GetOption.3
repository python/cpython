.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This procedure is invoked to retrieve an option from the database
associated with \fItkwin\fR's main window.  If there is an option
for \fItkwin\fR that matches the given \fIname\fR or \fIclass\fR,
then it is returned in the form of a Tk_Uid.  If multiple options
match \fIname\fR and \fIclass\fR, then the highest-priority one
is returned.  If no option matches, then NULL is returned.
.PP
\fBTk_GetOption\fR caches options related to \fItkwin\fR so that
successive calls for the same \fItkwin\fR will execute much more
quickly than successive calls for different windows.
.SH KEYWORDS
class, name, option, retrieve
