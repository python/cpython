.SH NAME
safe::loadTk \- Load Tk into a safe interpreter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsafe::loadTk \fIslave\fR ?\fB\-use\fR \fIwindowId\fR? ?\fB\-display\fR \fIdisplayName\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Safe Tk is based on Safe Tcl, which provides a mechanism that allows
restricted and mediated access to auto-loading and packages for safe
interpreters.  Safe Tk adds the ability to configure the interpreter for safe
Tk operations and load Tk into safe interpreters.
.PP
The \fBsafe::loadTk\fR command initializes the required data structures in
the named safe interpreter and then loads Tk into it.  The interpreter must
have been created with \fBsafe::interpCreate\fR or have been initialized
with \fBsafe::interpInit\fR.  The command returns the name of the safe
interpreter.  If \fB\-use\fR is specified, the window identified by the
specified system dependent identifier \fIwindowId\fR is used to contain the
.QW .
window of the safe interpreter; it can be any valid id, eventually referencing
a window belonging to another application. As a convenience, if the window you
plan to use is a Tk Window of the application you can use the window name
(e.g.,
.QW \fB.x.y\fR )
instead of its window Id (e.g., from \fBwinfo id\fR \fB.x.y\fR).
When \fB\-use\fR is not specified, a new toplevel window is created for the
.QW .
window of the safe interpreter. On X11 if you want the embedded window to use
another display than the default one, specify it with \fB\-display\fR.  See
the \fBSECURITY ISSUES\fR section below for implementation details.
.SH "SECURITY ISSUES"
.PP
Please read the \fBsafe\fR manual page for Tcl to learn about the basic
security considerations for Safe Tcl.
.PP
\fBsafe::loadTk\fR adds the value of \fBtk_library\fR taken from the master
interpreter to the virtual access path of the safe interpreter so that
auto-loading will work in the safe interpreter.
.PP
Tk initialization is now safe with respect to not trusting the slave's state
for startup. \fBsafe::loadTk\fR registers the slave's name so when the Tk
initialization (\fBTk_SafeInit\fR) is called and in turn calls the master's
\fBsafe::InitTk\fR it will return the desired \fBargv\fR equivalent
(\fB\-use\fR \fIwindowId\fR, correct \fB\-display\fR, etc.)
.PP
When \fB\-use\fR is not used, the new toplevel created is specially decorated
so the user is always aware that the user interface presented comes from a
potentially unsafe code and can easily delete the corresponding interpreter.
.PP
On X11, conflicting \fB\-use\fR and \fB\-display\fR are likely to generate a
fatal X error.
