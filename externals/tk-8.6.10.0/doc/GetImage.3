.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are invoked by widgets that wish to display images.
\fBTk_GetImage\fR is invoked by a widget when it first decides to
display an image.
\fIname\fR gives the name of the desired image and \fItkwin\fR
identifies the window where the image will be displayed.
\fBTk_GetImage\fR looks up the image in the table of existing
images and returns a token for a new instance of the image.
If the image does not exist then \fBTk_GetImage\fR returns NULL
and leaves an error message in interpreter \fIinterp\fR's result.
.PP
When a widget wishes to actually display an image it must
call \fBTk_RedrawImage\fR, identifying the image (\fIimage\fR),
a region within the image to redisplay (\fIimageX\fR, \fIimageY\fR,
\fIwidth\fR, and \fIheight\fR), and a place to display the
image (\fIdrawable\fR, \fIdrawableX\fR, and \fIdrawableY\fR).
Tk will then invoke the appropriate image manager, which will
display the requested portion of the image before returning.
.PP
A widget can find out the dimensions of an image by calling
\fBTk_SizeOfImage\fR:  the width and height will be stored
in the locations given by \fIwidthPtr\fR and \fIheightPtr\fR,
respectively.
.PP
When a widget is finished with an image (e.g., the widget is
being deleted or it is going to use a different image instead
of the current one), it must call \fBTk_FreeImage\fR to
release the image instance.
The widget should never again use the image token after passing
it to \fBTk_FreeImage\fR.
There must be exactly one call to \fBTk_FreeImage\fR for each
call to \fBTk_GetImage\fR.
.PP
If the contents or size of an image changes, then any widgets
using the image will need to find out about the changes so that
they can redisplay themselves.
The \fIchangeProc\fR and \fIclientData\fR arguments to
\fBTk_GetImage\fR are used for this purpose.
\fIchangeProc\fR will be called by Tk whenever a change occurs
in the image;  it must match the following prototype:
.CS
typedef void \fBTk_ImageChangedProc\fR(
        ClientData \fIclientData\fR,
        int \fIx\fR,
        int \fIy\fR,
        int \fIwidth\fR,
        int \fIheight\fR,
        int \fIimageWidth\fR,
        int \fIimageHeight\fR);
.CE
The \fIclientData\fR argument to \fIchangeProc\fR is the same as the
\fIclientData\fR argument to \fBTk_GetImage\fR.
It is usually a pointer to the widget record for the widget or
some other data structure managed by the widget.
The arguments \fIx\fR, \fIy\fR, \fIwidth\fR, and \fIheight\fR
identify a region within the image that must be redisplayed;
they are specified in pixels measured from the upper-left
corner of the image.
The arguments \fIimageWidth\fR and \fIimageHeight\fR give
the image's (new) size.
