.AP "int" width in

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These procedures are identical to the Xlib procedures \fBXCreatePixmap\fR
and \fBXFreePixmap\fR, except that they have extra code to manage X
resource identifiers so that identifiers for deleted pixmaps can be
reused in the future.
It is important for Tk applications to use these procedures rather
than \fBXCreatePixmap\fR and \fBXFreePixmap\fR;  otherwise long-running
applications may run out of resource identifiers.
.PP
\fBTk_GetPixmap\fR creates a pixmap suitable for drawing in \fId\fR,
with dimensions given by \fIwidth\fR, \fIheight\fR, and \fIdepth\fR,
and returns its identifier.
\fBTk_FreePixmap\fR destroys the pixmap given by \fIpixmap\fR and makes
its resource identifier available for reuse.
.SH KEYWORDS
pixmap, resource identifier
