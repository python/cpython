.SH NAME
Tk_InitConsoleChannels \- Install the console channels as standard channels
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tk.h>\fR
.sp
\fBTk_InitConsoleChannels\fR(\fIinterp\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *interp in
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter in which the console channels are created.
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTk_InitConsoleChannels\fR is invoked to create a set of console
channels and install them as the standard channels. All I/O on these
channels will be discarded until \fBTk_CreateConsoleWindow\fR is
called to attach the console to a text widget.
.PP
This function is for use by shell applications based on Tk, like
\fBwish\fR, on platforms which have no standard channels in graphical
mode, like Win32.
.PP
The \fIinterp\fR argument is the interpreter in which to create and
install the console channels.
.PP
\fBNOTE:\fR If this function is used it has to be called before the
first call to \fBTcl_RegisterChannel\fR, directly, or indirectly
through other channel functions. Because otherwise the standard
channels will be already initialized to the system defaults, which will
be nonsensical for the case \fBTk_InitConsoleChannels\fR is for.
