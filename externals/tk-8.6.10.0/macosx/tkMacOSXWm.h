 * Flag values for WmInfo structures:
 *
 * WM_NEVER_MAPPED -		non-zero means window has never been mapped;
 *				need to update all info when window is first
 *				mapped.
 * WM_UPDATE_PENDING -		non-zero means a call to UpdateGeometryInfo
 *				has already been scheduled for this window; no
 *				need to schedule another one.
 * WM_NEGATIVE_X -		non-zero means x-coordinate is measured in
 *				pixels from right edge of screen, rather than
 *				from left edge.
 * WM_NEGATIVE_Y -		non-zero means y-coordinate is measured in
 *				pixels up from bottom of screen, rather than
 *				down from top.
 * WM_UPDATE_SIZE_HINTS -	non-zero means that new size hints need to be
 *				propagated to window manager.
 * WM_SYNC_PENDING -		set to non-zero while waiting for the window
 *				manager to respond to some state change.
 * WM_VROOT_OFFSET_STALE -	non-zero means that (x,y) offset information
 *				about the virtual root window is stale and
 *				needs to be fetched fresh from the X server.
 * WM_ABOUT_TO_MAP -		non-zero means that the window is about to be
 *				mapped by TkWmMapWindow. This is used by
 *				UpdateGeometryInfo to modify its behavior.
 * WM_MOVE_PENDING -		non-zero means the application has requested a
 *				new position for the window, but it hasn't
 *				been reflected through the window manager yet.
 * WM_COLORMAPS_EXPLICIT -	non-zero means the colormap windows were set
 *				explicitly via "wm colormapwindows".
 * WM_ADDED_TOPLEVEL_COLORMAP - non-zero means that when "wm colormapwindows"
 *				was called the top-level itself wasn't
 *				specified, so we added it implicitly at the
 *				end of the list.
 * WM_WIDTH_NOT_RESIZABLE -	non-zero means that we're not supposed to
 *				allow the user to change the width of the
 *				window (controlled by "wm resizable" command).
 * WM_HEIGHT_NOT_RESIZABLE -	non-zero means that we're not supposed to
 *				allow the user to change the height of the
 *				window (controlled by "wm resizable" command).
