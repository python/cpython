"""
This package provides functions to generate flags for CPUID and XSAVE.

The constants are macros generated by Argument Clinic as follows:

    #define <MACRO_NAME><TAB>  0x<MASK><TAB> // bit = BIT
                               ^             ^

where ^ indicates a column that is a multiple of 4, <MASK> has
exactly 8 characters and <BIT> has at most 2 characters.

A C enumeration is NOT generated as the largest member may not fit
on an 'int', which is forbidden as ISO C restricts enumerator values
to that range.

.. note::

   This package must not be used directly and should only be
   invoked from an Argument Clinic "[python input]" directive.
