"""reindent [-d][-r][-v] path ...

-d  Dry run.  Analyze, but don't make any changes to, files.
-r  Recurse.  Search for all .py files in subdirectories too.
-v  Verbose.  Print informative msgs; else no output.

Change Python (.py) files to use 4-space indents and no hard tab characters.
Also trim excess whitespace from ends of lines, and empty lines at the ends
of files.  Ensure the last line ends with a newline.

Pass one or more file and/or directory paths.  When a directory path, all
.py files within the directory will be examined, and, if the -r option is
given, likewise recursively for subdirectories.

Overwrites files in place, renaming the originals with a .bak extension.
If reindent finds nothing to change, the file is left alone.  If reindent
does change a file, the changed file is a fixed-point for reindent (i.e.,
running reindent on the resulting .py file won't change it again).

The hard part of reindenting is figuring out what to do with comment
lines.  So long as the input files get a clean bill of health from
tabnanny.py, reindent should do a good job.
