# Help file for the FAQ Edit Wizard

HELP = """
Using the %(FAQNAME)s Edit Wizard speaks mostly for itself.  Here are
some answers to questions you are likely to ask:

<P><HR>

<H2>I can review an entry but I can't commit it.</H2>

The commit button only appears if the following conditions are met:

<UL>

<LI>The Name field is not empty.

<LI>The Email field contains at least an @ character.

<LI>The Log message box is not empty.

<LI>The Password field contains the proper password.

</UL>

<P><HR>

<H2>What is the password?</H2>

At the moment, only PSA members will be told the password.  This is a
good time to join the PSA!  See <A
HREF="http://www.python.org/psa/">the PSA home page</A>.

<P><HR>

<H2>Can I use HTML in the FAQ entry?</H2>

Yes, if you include it in &lt;HTML&rt; and &lt;/HTML&gt; tags.
<P>
Also, if you include a URL or an email address in the text it will
automatigally become an anchor of the right type.  Also, *word*
is made italic (but only for single alphabetic words).

<P><HR>

<H2>How do I delineate paragraphs?</H2>

Use blank lines to separate paragraphs.

<P><HR>

<H2>How do I enter example text?</H2>

Any line that begins with a space or tab is assumed to be part of
literal text.  Blocks of literal text delineated by blank lines are
placed inside &lt;PRE&gt;...&lt;/PRE&gt;.
