Tue Feb 16 22:34:17 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	Only pop up the stack viewer when requested in the Debug menu.

Mon Feb  8 22:27:49 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* WindowList.py: Don't crash if a window no longer exists.

	* TODO.txt: Restructured a bit.

Mon Feb  1 23:06:17 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* PyShell.py: Add current dir or paths of file args to sys.path.

	* Debugger.py: Add canonic() function -- for brand new bdb.py feature.

	* StackViewer.py: Protect against accessing an empty stack.

Fri Jan 29 20:44:45 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ZoomHeight.py:
	Use only the height to decide whether to zoom in or out.

Thu Jan 28 22:24:30 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* EditorWindow.py, FileList.py:
	Make sure the Tcl variables are shared between windows.

	* PyShell.py, EditorWindow.py, Bindings.py:
	Move menu/key binding code from Bindings.py to EditorWindow.py,
	with changed APIs -- it makes much more sense there.
	Also add a new feature: if the first character of a menu label is
	a '!', it gets a checkbox.  Checkboxes are bound to Boolean Tcl variables
	that can be accessed through the new getvar/setvar/getrawvar API;
	the variable is named after the event to which the menu is bound.

	* Debugger.py: Add Quit button to the debugger window.

	* SearchDialog.py:
	When find_again() finds exactly the current selection, it's a failure.

	* idle.py, Attic/idle: Rename idle -> idle.py

Mon Jan 18 15:18:57 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* EditorWindow.py, WindowList.py: Only deiconify when iconic.

	* TODO.txt: Misc

Tue Jan 12 22:14:34 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* testcode.py, Attic/test.py:
	Renamed test.py to testcode.py so one can import Python's
	test package from inside IDLE.  (Suggested by Jack Jansen.)

	* EditorWindow.py, ColorDelegator.py:
	Hack to close a window that is colorizing.

	* Separator.py: Vladimir Marangozov's patch:
	The separator dances too much and seems to jump by arbitrary amounts
	in arbitrary directions when I try to move it for resizing the frames.
	This patch makes it more quiet.

Mon Jan 11 14:52:40 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TODO.txt: Some requests have been fulfilled.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Set the cursor to a watch when opening the class browser (which may
	take quite a while, browsing multiple files).

	Newer, better center() -- but assumes no wrapping.

	* SearchBinding.py:
	Got rid of debug print statement in goto_line_event().

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	I think I like it better if it prints the traceback even when it displays
	the stack viewer.

	* Debugger.py: Bind ESC to close-window.

	* ClassBrowser.py: Use a HSeparator between the classes and the items.
	Make the list of classes wider by default (40 chars).
	Bind ESC to close-window.

	* Separator.py:
	Separator classes (draggable divider between two panes).

Sat Jan  9 22:01:33 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* WindowList.py:
	Don't traceback when wakeup() is called when the window has been destroyed.
	This can happen when a torn-of Windows menu references closed windows.
	And Tim Peters claims that the Windows menu is his favorite to tear off...

	* EditorWindow.py: Allow tearing off of the Windows menu.

	* StackViewer.py: Close on ESC.

	* help.txt: Updated a bunch of things (it was mostly still 0.1!)

	* extend.py: Added ScriptBinding to standard bindings.

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	This now actually works.  See doc string.  It can run a module (i.e.
	import or reload) or debug it (same with debugger control).  Output
	goes to a fresh output window, only created when needed.

	Paul Prescod's patches to allow the stack viewer to pop up when a
	traceback is printed.

Thu Jan  7 00:12:15 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FormatParagraph.py:
	Change paragraph width limit to 70 (like Emacs M-Q).

	* README.txt:
	Separating TODO from README.  Slight reformulation of features.  No
	exact release date.

	* TODO.txt: Separating TODO from README.

Mon Jan  4 21:19:09 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FormatParagraph.py:
	Hm.  There was a boundary condition error at the end of the file too.

	* SearchBinding.py: Hm.  Add Unix binding for replace, too.

	* keydefs.py: Ran eventparse.py again.

	* FormatParagraph.py: Added Unix Meta-q key binding;
	fix find_paragraph when at start of file.

	* AutoExpand.py: Added Meta-/ binding for Unix as alt for Alt-/.

	* SearchBinding.py:
	Add unix binding for grep (otherwise the menu entry doesn't work!)

	* ZoomHeight.py: Adjusted Unix height to work with fvwm96. :=(

	* GrepDialog.py: Need to import sys!

	* help.txt, extend.txt, README.txt: Formatted some paragraphs

	* extend.py, FormatParagraph.py:
	Add new extension to reformat a (text) paragraph.

	* ZoomHeight.py: Typo in Win specific height setting.

Sun Jan  3 00:47:35 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* AutoIndent.py: Added something like Tim Peters' backspace patch.

	* ZoomHeight.py: Adapted to Unix (i.e., more hardcoded constants).

Sat Jan  2 21:28:54 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* keydefs.py, idlever.py, idle.pyw, idle.bat, help.txt, extend.txt, extend.py, eventparse.py, ZoomHeight.py, WindowList.py, UndoDelegator.py, StackViewer.py, SearchEngine.py, SearchDialogBase.py, SearchDialog.py, ScrolledList.py, SearchBinding.py, ScriptBinding.py, ReplaceDialog.py, Attic/README, README.txt, PyShell.py, Attic/PopupMenu.py, OutputWindow.py, IOBinding.py, Attic/HelpWindow.py, History.py, GrepDialog.py, FileList.py, FrameViewer.py, EditorWindow.py, Debugger.py, Delegator.py, ColorDelegator.py, Bindings.py, ClassBrowser.py, AutoExpand.py, AutoIndent.py:
	Checking in IDLE 0.2.

	Much has changed -- too much, in fact, to write down.
	The big news is that there's a standard way to write IDLE extensions;
	see extend.txt.  Some sample extensions have been provided, and
	some existing code has been converted to extensions.  Probably the
	biggest new user feature is a new search dialog with more options,
	search and replace, and even search in files (grep).

	This is exactly as downloaded from my laptop after returning
	from the holidays -- it hasn't even been tested on Unix yet.

Fri Dec 18 15:52:54 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FileList.py, ClassBrowser.py:
	Fix the class browser to work even when the file is not on sys.path.

Tue Dec  8 20:39:36 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

Sat Oct 24 16:38:38 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Attic/turtle.py: Raise the root window on reset().
	Different action on WM_DELETE_WINDOW is more likely to do the right thing,
	allowing us to destroy old windows.

	* Attic/turtle.py:
	Split the goto() function in two: _goto() is the internal one,
	using Canvas coordinates, and goto() uses turtle coordinates
	and accepts variable argument lists.

	* Attic/turtle.py: Cope with destruction of the window

	* Attic/turtle.py: Turtle graphics

	* Debugger.py: Use of Breakpoint class should be bdb.Breakpoint.

	Patch linecache.checkcache() to keep our special entries alive.
	Add popup menu to all editor windows to set a breakpoint.

	Use and pass through the 'force' flag to set_dict() where appropriate.
	Default source and globals checkboxes to false.
	Don't interact in user_return().
	Add primitive set_breakpoint() method.

	* ColorDelegator.py:
	Raise priority of 'sel' tag so its foreground (on Windows) will take
	priority over text colorization (which on Windows is almost the
	same color as the selection background).

	Define a tag and color for breakpoints ("BREAK").

	* Attic/PopupMenu.py: Disable "Open stack viewer" and "help" commands.

	* StackViewer.py:
	Add optional 'force' argument (default 0) to load_dict().
	If set, redo the display even if it's the same dict.

Fri Oct 16 21:10:12 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* StackViewer.py: Do nothing when loading the same dict as before.

	* StackViewer.py:
	Rename classes to StackViewer (the widget) and StackBrowser (the toplevel).

Thu Oct 15 23:27:08 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ClassBrowser.py, ScrolledList.py:
	Generalized the scrolled list which is the base for the class and
	method browser into a separate class in its own module.

	* Attic/test.py: Cosmetic change

	* Debugger.py: Don't show function name if there is none

Wed Oct 14 03:43:05 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Debugger.py, PyShell.py: Polish the Debugger GUI a bit.
	Closing it now also does the right thing.

Tue Oct 13 23:51:13 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Debugger.py, PyShell.py, Bindings.py:
	Ad primitive debugger interface (so far it will step and show you the

	* ClassBrowser.py:
	Adding the beginnings of a Class browser.  Incomplete, yet.

	* EditorWindow.py, Bindings.py:
	Add new command, "Open module".  You select or type a module name,
	and it opens the source.

Mon Oct 12 23:59:27 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@eric.cnri.reston.va.us>

	* PyShell.py: Subsume functionality from Popup menu in Debug menu.
	Other stuff so the PyShell window can be resurrected from the Windows menu.

	* FileList.py: Get rid of PopUp menu.
	Create a simple Windows menu.  (Imperfect when Untitled windows exist.)
