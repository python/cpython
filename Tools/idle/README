TO DO:

- "Recent documents" menu item
- use platform specific default bindings
- title and Windows menu should have base filename first
- restructure state sensitive code to avoid testing flags all the time
- integrated debugger
- object browser instead of current stack viewer
- save some user state (e.g. window and cursor positions, bindings)
- make backups when saving
- check file mtimes at various points
- interface with RCS/CVS/Perforce ???
- more search options: case [in]sensitive, fwd/back, string/regex
- global query replace
- incremental search
- more emacsisms:
  - reindent, reformat text etc.
  - M-[, M-] to move by paragraphs
  - smart stuff with whitespace around Return
  - filter region?
  - grep?
- status bar?
- better help?

Details:
    
- when there's a selection, left/right arrow should go to either
  end of the selection
- ^O should honor autoindent

Structural problems:

- too much knowledge in FileList about EditorWindow (for example)
- Several occurrences of scrollable listbox with title and certain
  behavior; should create base class to generalize this
- class browser could become an outline?

Comparison to PTUI
------------------

- PTUI's shell is worse:
  no coloring;
  no editing of multi-line commands;
  ^P seems to permanently remove some text from the buffer

- PTUI's undo is worse:
  no redo;
  one char at a time

- PTUI's framework is better:
  status line
  (not sure if I like the toolbar)

- PTUI's GUI is a tad ugly:
  I don't like the multiple buffers in one window model

- PTUI's help is better (HTML!)

- PTUI's search/replace is better (more features)

- PTUI's auto indent is better
  (understands that "if a: # blah, blah" opens a block)

- PTUI's key bindings are a bit weird (DEL to dedent a line!?!?!?)

- PTUI's fontify is faster but synchronous (and still too slow);
  also doesn't do as good a job if editing affects lines far below

- PTUI has more bells and whistles:
  open multiple
  append
  zap tabs
  fontify (you could argue it's not needed in my code)
  comment/uncomment
  modularize
  examine
  go
