description: Update teaching-todo.md with progress and notes from our session
---

Review the conversation and update the learning progress in @teaching-todo.md:

1. Mark completed items with `[x]`
2. Mark partially completed items with `[~]`
3. Add **Notes from session:** sections under completed topics with key learnings, Q&A, and decisions made

Focus on what we actually discussed and learned - don't mark items complete unless we covered them.
