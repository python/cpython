# FILE:		defmakexp_aix
# TYPE:         standalone executable
# SYSTEM:       AIX, Solaris
#
# DESCRIPTION:  This script creates the default export list file "python.exp"
#		for AIX platforms which has to be included in the Modules
#		directory of the python source tree.
#		It contains all	global symbols defined in the following files:
#			a) python.o
#			b) ../libpython1.5.a
#
#		The script should be run after a new unpack, configure & make
#		of the python release, without any options nor changes to
#		Modules/Setup.in (i.e. a default static build).
#
# USAGE:	defmakexp_aix [path]
#
#		where [path] points to the Python source root directory.
# ============================================================================

#
# Check for AIX or Solaris
