# -*- makefile -*-
# The file Setup is used by the makesetup script to construct the files
# Makefile and config.c, from Makefile.pre and config.c.in,
# respectively.  The file Setup itself is initially copied from
# Setup.in; once it exists it will not be overwritten, so you can edit
# Setup to your heart's content.  Note that Makefile.pre is created
# from Makefile.pre.in by the toplevel configure script.

# (VPATH notes: Setup and Makefile.pre are in the build directory, as
# are Makefile and config.c; the *.in files are in the source
# directory.)

# Each line in this file describes one or more optional modules.
# Comment out lines to suppress modules.
# Lines have the following structure:
#
# <module> ... [<sourcefile> ...] [<cpparg> ...] [<library> ...]
#
# <sourcefile> is anything ending in .c (.C, .cc, .c++ are C++ files)
# <cpparg> is anything starting with -I, -D, -U or -C
# <library> is anything ending in .a or beginning with -l or -L
# <module> is anything else but should be a valid Python
# identifier (letters, digits, underscores, beginning with non-digit)
#
# (As the makesetup script changes, it may recognize some other
# arguments as well, e.g. *.so and *.sl as libraries.  See the big
# case statement in the makesetup script.)
#
# Lines can also have the form
#
# <name> = <value>
#
# which defines a Make variable definition inserted into Makefile.in
#
# Finally, if a line has the literal form
#
# *shared*
#
# (that is including the '*' and '*' !) then the following modules will
# not be included in the config.c file, nor in the list of objects to be
# added to the library archive, and their linker options won't be added 
# to the linker options, but rules to create their .o files and their
# shared libraries will still be added to the Makefile, and their
# names will be collected in the Make variable SHAREDMODS.  This is
# used to build modules as shared libraries.  (They must be installed
# using "make sharedinstall".)  (For compatibility, *noconfig* has the
# same effect as *shared*.)

# NOTE: As a standard policy, as many modules as can be supported by a
# platform should be present.  The distribution comes with all modules
# enabled that are supported by most platforms and don't require you
# to ftp sources from elsewhere.


# Some special rules to define PYTHONPATH.
# Edit the definitions below to indicate which options you are using.

# The modules listed here can't be built as shared libraries for
# various reasons; therefore they are listed here instead of in the
# normal order.

# Some modules that are normally always on:

regex regexmodule.c regexpr.c	# Regular expressions, GNU Emacs style
reop reopmodule.c		# Additional RE support (for re1.py)
pcre pcremodule.c pypcre.c	# Regular expressions, Perl style (for re.py)
posix posixmodule.c		# posix (UNIX) system calls
signal signalmodule.c		# signal(2)

# The SGI specific GL module:

#gl glmodule.c cgensupport.c -I$(srcdir) -lgl -lX11

# Thread module -- use only if Python has thread support for your OS.
# Note that you must have configured (and built!) Python with the
# --with-thread option passed to the configure script for this to work:

#thread threadmodule.c

# Pure module.  Cannot be linked dynamically.
# -DWITH_QUANTIFY, -DWITH_PURIFY, or -DWITH_ALL_PURE
#WHICH_PURE_PRODUCTS=-DWITH_ALL_PURE
#PURE_INCLS=-I/usr/local/include
#PURE_STUBLIBS=-L/usr/local/lib -lpurify_stubs -lquantify_stubs
#pure puremodule.c $(WHICH_PURE_PRODUCTS) $(PURE_INCLS) $(PURE_STUBLIBS)

# Uncommenting the following line tells makesetup that all following
# modules are to be built as shared libraries (see above for more
# detail):

#*shared*

# GNU readline.  Unlike previous Python incarnations, GNU readline is
# now incorporated in an optional module, configured in the Setup file
# instead of by a configure script switch.  You may have to insert a
# -L option pointing to the directory where libreadline.* lives,
# and you may have to change -ltermcap to -ltermlib or perhaps remove
# it, depending on your system -- see the GNU readline instructions.
# It's okay for this to be a shared library, too.

#readline readline.c -lreadline -ltermcap


# Modules that should always be present (non UNIX dependent):

array arraymodule.c	# array objects
cmath cmathmodule.c # -lm # complex math library functions
math mathmodule.c # -lm # math library functions, e.g. sin()
strop stropmodule.c	# fast string operations implemented in C
struct structmodule.c	# binary structure packing/unpacking
time timemodule.c # -lm # time operations and variables
operator operator.c	# operator.add() and similar goodies


# Modules with some UNIX dependencies -- on by default:
# (If you have a really backward UNIX, select and socket may not be
# supported...)

fcntl fcntlmodule.c	# fcntl(2) and ioctl(2)
pwd pwdmodule.c		# pwd(3) 
grp grpmodule.c		# grp(3)
crypt cryptmodule.c # -lcrypt	# crypt(3); needs -lcrypt on some systems
select selectmodule.c	# select(2); not on ancient System V
socket socketmodule.c	# socket(2); not on ancient System V
errno errnomodule.c	# posix (UNIX) errno values


# Some more UNIX dependent modules -- off by default, since these
# are not supported by all UNIX systems:

#dbm dbmmodule.c 	# dbm(3) may require -lndbm or similar
#nis nismodule.c 	# Sun yellow pages -- not everywhere
#termios termios.c	# Steen Lumholt's termios module
#resource resource.c	# Jeremy Hylton's rlimit interface


# Multimedia modules -- off by default.
# These don't for 64-bit platforms!!!
# These represent audio samples or images as strings:

#audioop audioop.c	# Operations on audio samples
#imageop imageop.c	# Operations on images
#rgbimg rgbimgmodule.c   # Read SGI RGB image files (but coded portably)


# The stdwin module provides a simple, portable (between X11 and Mac)
# windowing interface.  You need to ftp the STDWIN library, e.g. from
# ftp://ftp.cwi.nl/pub/stdwin.  (If you get it elsewhere, be sure to
# get version 1.0 or higher!)  The STDWIN variable must point to the
# STDWIN toplevel directory.

# Uncomment and edit as needed:
#STDWIN=/ufs/guido/src/stdwin

# Uncomment these lines:
#STDWINPATH=:lib-stdwin
#LIBTEXTEDIT=$(STDWIN)/$(MACHDEP)/Packs/textedit/libtextedit.a

# The md5 module implements the RSA Data Security, Inc. MD5
# Message-Digest Algorithm, described in RFC 1321.  The necessary files
# md5c.c and md5.h are included here.

# The mpz module interfaces to the GNU Multiple Precision library.
# You need to ftp the GNU MP library.  
# The GMP variable must point to the GMP source directory.
# This was originally written and tested against GMP 1.2 and 1.3.2.
# It has been modified by Rob Hooft to work with 2.0.2 as well, but I
# haven't tested it recently.

# A compatible MP library unencombered by the GPL also exists.  It was
# posted to comp.sources.misc in volume 40 and is widely available from
# FTP archive sites. One URL for it is:
# ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/.b/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume40/fgmp/part01.Z

# *** gl must be enabled higher up in this file ***
#fm fmmodule.c -lfm -lgl		# Font Manager
#sgi sgimodule.c			# sgi.nap() and a few more

# This module requires the header file
# /usr/people/4Dgifts/iristools/include/izoom.h:
#imgfile imgfile.c -limage -lgutil -lgl -lm	# Image Processing Utilities


# These modules require the Multimedia Development Option (I think):

#al almodule.c -laudio			# Audio Library

# The FORMS library, by Mark Overmars, implements user interface
# components such as dialogs and buttons using SGI's GL and FM
# libraries.  You must ftp the FORMS library separately from
# ftp://ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/SGI/FORMS.  It was tested with FORMS 2.2a.
# The FORMS variable must point to the FORMS subdirectory of the forms
# toplevel directory:

#FORMS=/ufs/guido/src/forms/FORMS
#fl flmodule.c -I$(FORMS) $(FORMS)/libforms.a -lfm -lgl


# SunOS specific modules -- off by default:

#sunaudiodev sunaudiodev.c


# George Neville-Neil's timing module:

#timing timingmodule.c


# The _tkinter module.
#
# See the section "The Tk interface" in ../README for more info.
#
# Enable the TKPATH line and choose the most applicable _tkinter line.
# You may have to change /usr/local to wherever Tcl/Tk are installed.
# Change the -l arguments to use Tcl 7.4 and Tk 4.0!

# *** ALWAYS enable this line:
#TKPATH=:lib-tk

# *** Enable *one* of the following lines:
# For Solaris:
#_tkinter _tkinter.c -I/usr/openwin/include -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/openwin/lib -L/usr/local/lib -ltk4.1 -ltcl7.5 -lX11

# Lance's curses module.  This requires the System V version of
# curses, sometimes known as ncurses (e.g. on Linux, link with
# -lncurses instead of -lcurses; on SunOS 4.1.3, insert -I/usr/5include
# -L/usr/5lib before -lcurses).

# Tommy Burnette's 'new' module (creates new empty objects of certain kinds):

#new newmodule.c


# Generic (SunOS / SVR4) dynamic loading module.
