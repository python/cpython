	Changes since Python 1.2 for the mac
	------------------------------------
These relnotes are relative to the last "official" MacPython release,
not to the intermediate releases.
- PPC python now uses a shared library organization. This allows the
  creation of dynamically loadable extension modules (contact me) and
  creation of python applets (see mkapplet.py). A number of previously
  builtin modules are now dynamically loaded. Dynamically loaded
  modules are distributed in the PlugIns folder.
- Python modules can live in 'PYC ' resources (with a name equal to the
  module name, so many modules can live in a single file). If you put a
  file (in stead of a folder) in sys.path its resources will be searched.
  See the PackLibDir script for creating such a file.
- new binhex module (partially working, hexbin has problems)
- Python now has a Preferences file, editable with
  EditPythonPrefs. Remembered are the python 'home folder' and the
  initial value for sys.path. If no preferences file is found a simple
  one is created.
  NOTE: this only works correctly if you start python the first time
  from the correct folder.
- new img modules, to read/write/convert images in various formats
- new MacOS toolbox modules: AE, Ctl, Dlg, Event, List, Qd, Res, Snd
  and Win. These provide access to various of the MacOS toolbox
  interfaces. No documentation yet, but the __doc__ strings provide at
  least the calling sequence (and Inside Mac will give you the
  semantics). Minimal demos are provided for most toolbox interfaces,
  and the 'scripts' directory has some more examples.
- AppleEvent client interfaces can be generated from aete/aeut
  resources. No support for objects yet, nor for server interfaces.
- Lib:mac:FrameWork.py has an application framework (under
  construction). 
- (PPC Only) support for building Python applets: tiny standalone
  python applications.
- fp = open(filename, '*r') opens resource-fork of a file for reading
  (and similar for writing).
- option-dragging a file to the interpreter (or immedeately pressing
  <option> after launching python) will bring up an Options dialog
  allowing you to set options like import-tracing, etc.
- MacOS module method added: GetErrorString(OSErr) -> error string
- There is now a numbering convention for resource-ID's:
  128-255	Resources used by the interpreter itself
  256-511	Resources used by standard modules
  512-		Resources for applications
- macfs module changes:
  - StandardGetFile without type arguments now shows all files
  - PromptGetFile(prompt, ...) is like StandardGetFile but with a
    prompt
  - GetDirectory (let user select a folder) added
  - GetFInfo and SetFInfo methods of FSSpec objects get/set finder
    info. FInfo objects have attributes Creator, Type, etc.
  - FindFolder (locate trash/preferences/etc) added
- mactcp/macdnr changes: bug fix wrt idle-loop.
- EditPythonPrefs script: change initial sys.path and python home
  folder
- (PPC only) MkPluginAliases: Setup aliases for dynamically loadable
  modules that live in a single shared library
- PackLibDir: Convert Lib directory to a single resource file
  containing all .pyc code
- fixfiletypes: Set file types based on file extension over a whole
  tree.
- RunLibScript: Run any script as main program, optionally redirecting
  stdin/stdout, supplying arguments, etc.
- binhextree: Binhex all files in a tree, depending on the extension.
- (PPC only) mkapplet: Create a python applet from a sourcefile and
  (optional) resourcefile.
