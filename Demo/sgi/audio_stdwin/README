Three programs that provide a user interface based upon STDWIN to the
audio device of the SGI 4D/25.  These scripts also demonstrate the power
of a set of window interface classes implemented in Python that simplify
the construction of all sorts of buttons, etc.

XXX This hardware is already obsolete; see ../al for examples of audio
XXX on the Indigo and 4D/35.

jukebox		Browses a directory full of sound samples and lets you
		play selected ones.  (Probably not fully functional, it
		requires a conversion program.)

rec		A tape recorder that lets you record a sound sample,
		play it back, and save it to a file.  Various options to
		set sampling rate, volume etc.  When idle it doubles
		as a VU meter.

vumeter		A VU meter that displays a history of the volume of
		sound recently sampled from the microphone.
