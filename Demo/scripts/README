This directory contains a collection of executable Python scripts.

Some perform Python housekeeping jobs (e.g., converting old syntax or
generating tags files), others are useful UNIX tools, are some are
just cute demos (e.g., pi.py).

A number of these of these deserve a link in your bin directory.  All
deserve study if you want to learn Python programming.
