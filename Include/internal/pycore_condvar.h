/* The ConditionVariable object.  From XP onwards it is easily emulated
   with a Semaphore.
   Semaphores are available on Windows XP (2003 server) and later.
   We use a Semaphore rather than an auto-reset event, because although
   an auto-reset event might appear to solve the lost-wakeup bug (race
   condition between releasing the outer lock and waiting) because it
   maintains state even though a wait hasn't happened, there is still
   a lost wakeup problem if more than one thread are interrupted in the
   critical place.  A semaphore solves that, because its state is
   counted, not Boolean.
   Because it is ok to signal a condition variable with no one
   waiting, we need to keep track of the number of
   waiting threads.  Otherwise, the semaphore's state could rise
   without bound.  This also helps reduce the number of "spurious wakeups"
   that would otherwise happen.
