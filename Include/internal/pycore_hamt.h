/*
HAMT tree is shaped by hashes of keys. Every group of 5 bits of a hash denotes
the exact position of the key in one level of the tree. Since we're using
32 bit hashes, we can have at most 7 such levels. Although if there are
two distinct keys with equal hashes, they will have to occupy the same
cell in the 7th level of the tree -- so we'd put them in a "collision" node.
Which brings the total possible tree depth to 8. Read more about the actual
layout of the HAMT tree in `hamt.c`.

This constant is used to define a datastucture for storing iteration state.

/* A struct to hold the state of depth-first traverse of the tree.

   HAMT is an immutable collection.  Iterators will hold a strong reference
   to it, and every node in the HAMT has strong references to its children.

   So for iterators, we can implement zero allocations and zero reference
   inc/dec depth-first iteration.

   - i_level: the current node in i_nodes
   - i_pos: an array of positions within nodes in i_nodes.
