/* Dictionary object type -- mapping from hashable object to object */

/* The distribution includes a separate file, Objects/dictnotes.txt,
   describing explorations into dictionary design and optimization.  
   It covers typical dictionary use patterns, the parameters for
   tuning dictionaries, and several ideas for possible optimizations.
*/

/*
There are three kinds of slots in the table:

1. Unused.  me_key == me_value == NULL
   Does not hold an active (key, value) pair now and never did.  Unused can
   transition to Active upon key insertion.  This is the only case in which
   me_key is NULL, and is each slot's initial state.

2. Active.  me_key != NULL and me_key != dummy and me_value != NULL
   Holds an active (key, value) pair.  Active can transition to Dummy upon
   key deletion.  This is the only case in which me_value != NULL.

3. Dummy.  me_key == dummy and me_value == NULL
   Previously held an active (key, value) pair, but that was deleted and an
   active pair has not yet overwritten the slot.  Dummy can transition to
   Active upon key insertion.  Dummy slots cannot be made Unused again
   (cannot have me_key set to NULL), else the probe sequence in case of
   collision would have no way to know they were once active.

Note: .popitem() abuses the me_hash field of an Unused or Dummy slot to
hold a search finger.  The me_hash field of Unused or Dummy slots has no
meaning otherwise.
*/

/* PyDict_MINSIZE is the minimum size of a dictionary.  This many slots are
 * allocated directly in the dict object (in the ma_smalltable member).
 * It must be a power of 2, and at least 4.  8 allows dicts with no more
 * than 5 active entries to live in ma_smalltable (and so avoid an
 * additional malloc); instrumentation suggested this suffices for the
 * majority of dicts (consisting mostly of usually-small instance dicts and
 * usually-small dicts created to pass keyword arguments).

To avoid slowing down lookups on a near-full table, we resize the table when
