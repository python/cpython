          # New to Python?

          The issue tracker isn't the right place to get help. Consider instead:

            - reading the [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
            - posting on [Discourse](https://discuss.python.org/c/users/7)
            - emailing [python-list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-list)
  - type: checkboxes
    attributes:
      label: Checklist
      description: Bugs in third-party projects (e.g. `requests`) do not belong in the CPython issue tracker
      options:
        - label: I am confident this is a bug in CPython, not a bug in a third-party project
          required: true

            I have searched the [CPython issue tracker](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-desc),
            and am confident this bug has not been reported before
