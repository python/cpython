          This form is for hard crashes of the Python interpreter, segmentation faults, failed C-level assertions, and similar.
          Unexpected exceptions raised from Python functions in the standard library count as bugs rather than crashes.

          The CPython interpreter is written in a different programming language, C.
          A "CPython crash" is when Python itself fails, leading to a traceback in the C stack.
