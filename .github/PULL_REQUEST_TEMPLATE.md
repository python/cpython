It should be in the following format:

```

Where: bpo-NNNN refers to the issue number in the https://bugs.python.org.

Most PRs will require an issue number. Trivial changes, like fixing a typo, do not need an issue.

please ensure that the PR title is in the following format:

```
[X.Y] <title from the original PR> (GH-NNNN)

Where: [X.Y] is the branch name, e.g. [3.6].
