" vimrc file for following the coding standards specified in PEP 7 & 8.

" To use this file, source it in your own personal .vimrc file (``source
" <filename>``) or, if you don't have a .vimrc file, you can just symlink to it
" (``ln -s <this file> ~/.vimrc``).  All options are protected by autocmds
" (read below for an explanation of the command) so blind sourcing of this file
" is safe and will not affect your settings for non-Python or non-C files.

"
" All setting are protected by 'au' ('autocmd') statements.  Only files ending
" in .py or .pyw will trigger the Python settings while files ending in *.c or
" *.h will trigger the C settings.  This make the file "safe" in terms of only
" adjusting settings for Python and C files.
"
" Only basic settings needed to enforce the style guidelines are set.
" Some suggested options are listed but commented out at the end of this file.

" Number of spaces to use for an indent.
" This will affect Ctrl-T and 'autoindent'.
" Python: 4 spaces
" C: tab (8 spaces)
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*pyw set shiftwidth=4
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.c,*.h set shiftwidth=8

" Number of spaces that a pre-existing tab is equal to.
" For the amount of space used for a new tab use shiftwidth.
" Python: 8
" C: 8
au BufRead,BufNewFile *py,*pyw,*.c,*.h set tabstop=8

" Replace tabs with the equivalent number of spaces.
" Also have an autocmd for Makefiles since they require hard tabs.
" Python: yes
" C: no
" Makefile: no
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw set expandtab
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.c,*.h set noexpandtab
au BufRead,BufNewFile Makefile* set noexpandtab

" Wrap text after a certain number of characters
" Python: 79 
" C: 79
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw,*.c,*.h set textwidth=79

" Turn off settings in 'formatoptions' relating to comment formatting.
" - c : do not automatically insert the comment leader when wrapping based on
"    'textwidth'
" - o : do not insert the comment leader when using 'o' or 'O' from command mode
" - r : do not insert the comment leader when hitting <Enter> in insert mode
" Python: not needed
" C: prevents insertion of '*' at the beginning of every line in a comment
au BufRead,BufNewFile *.c,*.h set formatoptions-=c formatoptions-=o formatoptions-=r

" Use UNIX (\n) line endings.
" Only used for new files so as to not force existing files to change their
" line endings.
" Python: yes
" C: yes
au BufNewFile *.py,*.pyw,*.c,*.h set fileformat=unix

" The following section contains suggested settings.  While in no way required
" to meet coding standards, they are helpful.

" Set the default file encoding to UTF-8: ``set encoding=utf-8``

" Put a marker at the beginning of the file to differentiate between UTF and
" UCS encoding (WARNING: can trick shells into thinking a text file is actually
" a binary file when executing the text file): ``set bomb``

" For full syntax highlighting:
"``let python_highlight_all=1``
"``syntax on``

" Automatically indent: ``filetype indent on``

" Folding based on indentation: ``set foldmethod=indent``

" Make trailing whitespace explicit:
"highlight WhitespaceEOL ctermbg=red guibg=red 
"match WhitespaceEOL /\s\+$/
" or
"set list listchars=trail:-
