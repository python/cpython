Developer Log
=============

This file is a running log of developers given permissions on SourceForge.

The purpose is to provide some institutional memory of who was given access
and why.

The first entry starts in April 2005.  In keeping with the style of
Misc/NEWS, newer entries should be added to the top.  Any markup should
be in the form of ReST.  Entries should include the initials of the
project admin who made the change or granted access.  Feel free to revise
the format to accommodate documentation needs as they arise.



Permissions History
-------------------

- Added two new developers for the Summer of Code project. 8 July 2005
  by RDH.  Andrew Kuchling will be mentoring Gregory K Johnson for a
  project to enchance mailbox.  Brett Cannon requested access for Flovis
  (sirolf) to work on pstats, profile, and hotshot.  Both users are
  expected to work primarily in nondist/sandbox and have their work
  reviewed before making updates to active code.

- Reinhold Birkenfeld was given SF tracker permissions on 28 May 2005
  by RDH.  Since the beginning of 2005, he has been active in discussions
  on python-dev and has submitted a dozen patch reviews.  The permissions
  add the ability to change tracker status and to attach patches.  On
  3 June 2005, this was expanded by RDH to include checkin permissions.

- Terry Reedy was given SF tracker permissions on 7 Apr 2005 by RDH.

- Nick Coghlan was given SF tracker permissions on 5 Apr 2005 by RDH.
  For several months, he has been active in reviewing and contributing
  patches.  The added permissions give him greater flexibility in
  working with the tracker.

- Eric Price was made a developer on 2 May 2003 by TGP.  This was
  specifically to work on the new ``decimal`` package, which lived in
  ``nondist/sandbox/decimal/`` at the time.

- Eric S. Raymond was made a developer on 2 Jul 2000 by TGP, for general
  library work.  His request is archived here:
