What's New in Python 2.7.2?
===========================

*Release date: XXXX-XX-XX*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #8651: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise an OverflowError if the file
  doesn't have PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN define and the size doesn't fit in an int
  (length bigger than 2^31-1 bytes).

- Issue #8651: Fix "z#" format of PyArg_Parse*() function: the size was not
  written if PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN is defined.

- Issue #9756: When calling a method descriptor or a slot wrapper descriptor,
  the check of the object type doesn't read the __class__ attribute anymore.
  Fix a crash if a class override its __class__ attribute (e.g. a proxy of the
  str type). Patch written by Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #10517: After fork(), reinitialize the TLS used by the PyGILState_*
  APIs, to avoid a crash with the pthread implementation in RHEL 5.  Patch

  between narrow and wide builds while optimizing BINARY_SUBSCR on non-BMP
  chars (e.g. u"\U00012345"[0]).

- Issue #11650: PyOS_StdioReadline() retries fgets() if it was interrupted
  (EINTR), for example if the program is stopped with CTRL+z on Mac OS X. Patch
  written by Charles-Francois Natali.

  Previously, there were some corner cases where a long was returned even
  though the result was within the range of an int.

- Issue #11450: Don't truncate hg version info in Py_GetBuildInfo() when
  there are many tags (e.g. when using mq).  Patch by Nadeem Vawda.

  accepted by ``time.mktime`` and ``time.strftime`` is still system
  dependent, but ``time.mktime`` will now accept full range supported
  by the OS.  Conversion of 2-digit years to 4-digit is deprecated.

  browsers actually parse cookies.

- Issue #1379416: eliminated a source of accidental unicode promotion in
  email.header.Header.encode.

- Issue #5258/#10642: if site.py encounters a .pth file that generates an error,

  way of a signal handler) now raise a RuntimeError instead of freezing the
  current process.

- Issue #10497: Fix incorrect use of gettext in argparse.

- Issue #10464: netrc now correctly handles lines with embedded '#' characters.

- Issue #10125: Don't segfault when the iterator passed to
  ``file.writelines()`` closes the file.

- Issue #10186: Fix the SyntaxError caret when the offset is equal to the

  removing __del__ means that the internal doubly-linked list has to wait for
  GC collection rather than freeing memory immediately when the refcnt drops
  to zero.

- Issue #9816: random.Random.jumpahead(n) did not produce a sufficiently
  different internal state for small values of n.  Fixed by salting the
  value.

  original error is re-raised.

- Issue #9758: When fcntl.ioctl() was called with mutable_flag set to True,
  and the passed buffer was exactly 1024 bytes long, the buffer wouldn't

  ignored by the buffered IO layer anymore.

- Issue #2521: Use weakrefs on for caching in the abc module, so that classes
  are not held onto after they are deleted elsewhere.

- Issue #9626: the view methods for collections.OrderedDict() were returning
  the unordered versions inherited from dict.  Those methods are now
  overridden to provide ordered views.

- Issue #8688: MANIFEST files created by distutils now include a magic
  comment indicating they are generated.  Manually maintained MANIFESTs
  without this marker will not be overwritten or removed.

- Issue #7467: when reading a file from a ZIP archive, its CRC is checked
  and a BadZipfile error is raised if it doesn't match (as used to be the
  case in Python 2.5 and earlier).

- Issue #9550: a BufferedReader could issue an additional read when the
  original read request had been satisfied, which could block indefinitely
  when the underlying raw IO channel was e.g. a socket.  Report and original
  patch by Jason V. Miller.

- Issue #9551: Don't raise TypeError when setting the value to None for
  SafeConfigParser instances constructed with allow_no_value == True.

What's New in Python 2.7 Release Candidate 1?
=============================================

*Release date: 2010-06-05*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #8271: during the decoding of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, only the
  start byte and the continuation byte(s) are now considered invalid, instead
  of the number of bytes specified by the start byte.
  E.g.: '\xf1\x80AB'.decode('utf-8', 'replace') now returns u'\ufffdAB' and
  replaces with U+FFFD only the start byte ('\xf1') and the continuation byte
  ('\x80') even if '\xf1' is the start byte of a 4-bytes sequence.
  Previous versions returned a single u'\ufffd'.

- Issue #8627: Remove bogus "Overriding __cmp__ blocks inheritance of
  __hash__ in 3.x" warning.  Also fix "XXX undetected error" that
  arises from the "Overriding __eq__ blocks inheritance ..." warning
  when turned into an exception: in this case the exception simply
  gets ignored.

- Issue #8748: Fix two issues with comparisons between complex and integer
  objects.  (1) The comparison could incorrectly return True in some cases
  (2**53+1 == complex(2**53) == 2**53), breaking transivity of equality.
  (2) The comparison raised an OverflowError for large integers, leading
  to unpredictable exceptions when combining integers and complex objects
  in sets or dicts.

- Issue #5211: Implicit coercion for the complex type is now completely
  removed.  (Coercion for arithmetic operations was already removed in 2.7
  alpha 4, but coercion for rich comparisons was accidentally left in.)

- Issue #3798: Write sys.exit() message to sys.stderr to use stderr encoding
  and error handler, instead of writing to the C stderr file in utf-8

- Issue #7902: When using explicit relative import syntax, don't try implicit
  relative import semantics.

- Issue #7079: Fix a possible crash when closing a file object while using it
  from another thread.  Patch by Daniel Stutzbach.

- Issue #8868: Fix that ensures that python scripts have access to the
  Window Server again in a framework build on MacOSX 10.5 or earlier.

C-API
-----

- Issue #5753: A new C API function, :cfunc:`PySys_SetArgvEx`, allows embedders
  of the interpreter to set sys.argv without also modifying sys.path.  This
  helps fix `CVE-2008-5983
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5983>`_.

Library
-------

- Issue #8302: SkipTest in unittest.TestCase.setUpClass or setUpModule is now
  reported as a skip rather than an error.

  mistake.

- Issue #1368247: set_charset (and therefore MIMEText) now automatically
  encodes a unicode _payload to the output_charset.

- Issue #7150: Raise OverflowError if the result of adding or subtracting
  timedelta from date or datetime falls outside of the MINYEAR:MAXYEAR range.

  twice after seek(0). Fix also reset() method of codecs, UTF-16, UTF-32 and
  StreamWriter classes.

- Issue #5640: Fix Shift-JIS incremental encoder for error handlers different
  than 'strict'.

- Issue #8782: Add a trailing newline in linecache.updatecache to the last line
  of files without one.

- Issue #8729: Return NotImplemented from ``collections.Mapping.__eq__()`` when
  comparing to a non-mapping.

- Issue #8759: Fix user paths in sysconfig for posix and os2 schemes.

- Issue #1285086: Speed up ``urllib.quote()`` and urllib.unquote for simple
  cases.

- Issue #8688: Distutils now recalculates MANIFEST everytime.

- Issue #5099: The ``__del__()`` method of ``subprocess.Popen`` (and the methods
  it calls) referenced global objects, causing errors to pop up during
  interpreter shutdown.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #7384: If the system readline library is linked against ncurses,
  the curses module must be linked against ncurses as well. Otherwise it
  is not safe to load both the readline and curses modules in an application.

- Issue #2810: Fix cases where the Windows registry API returns
  ERROR_MORE_DATA, requiring a re-try in order to get the complete result.

- Issue #8674: Fixed a number of incorrect or undefined-behaviour-inducing
  overflow checks in the ``audioop`` module.

Tests
-----

- Issue #8889: test_support.transient_internet rewritten so that the new
  checks also work on FreeBSD, which lacks EAI_NODATA.

- Issue #8835: test_support.transient_internet() catches gaierror(EAI_NONAME)
  and gaierror(EAI_NODATA)

- Issue #7449: Skip test_socketserver if threading support is disabled

- On darwin, ``test_site`` assumed that a framework build was being used,
  leading to a failure where four directories were expected for site-packages
  instead of two in a non-framework build.

Build
-----

- Display installer warning that Windows 2000 won't be supported in future
  releases.

- Issues #1759169, #8864: Drop _XOPEN_SOURCE on Solaris, define it for
  multiprocessing only.

================================

*Release date: 2010-05-08*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Run Clang 2.7's static analyzer for ``Objects/`` and ``Python/``.

- Issue #1533: Fix inconsistency in range function argument processing: any
  non-float non-integer argument is now converted to an integer (if possible)
  using its __int__ method.  Previously, only small arguments were treated this
  way; larger arguments (those whose __int__ was outside the range of a C long)
  would produce a TypeError.

- Issue #8202: ``sys.argv[0]`` is now set to '-m' instead of '-c' when searching
  for the module file to be executed with the -m command line option.

- Issue #7319: When -Q is used, do not silence DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #7332: Remove the 16KB stack-based buffer in
  ``PyMarshal_ReadLastObjectFromFile``, which doesn't bring any noticeable

  passed to bytearray.

- Issue #7072: ``isspace(0xa0)`` is true on Mac OS X.

- Issue #8404: Fix set operations on dictionary views.

- Issue #8084: PEP 370 now conforms to system conventions for framework builds
  on MacOS X. That is, ``python setup.py install --user`` will install into
  ``~/Library/Python/2.7`` instead of ``~/.local``.

Library
-------

- Issue #8681: Make the zlib module's error messages more informative when the
  zlib itself doesn't give any detailed explanation.

- Issue #8571: Fix an internal error when compressing or decompressing a chunk
  larger than 1GB with the zlib module's compressor and decompressor objects.

- Issue #8573: asyncore ``_strerror()`` function might throw ValueError.

- Issue #8483: asyncore.dispatcher's __getattr__ method produced confusing error
  messages when accessing undefined class attributes because of the cheap
  inheritance with the underlying socket object.  The cheap inheritance has been
  deprecated.

- Issue #4265: ``shutil.copyfile()`` was leaking file descriptors when disk
  fills.  Patch by Tres Seaver.

- Issue #7755: Use an unencumbered audio file for tests.

- Issue #8621: ``uuid.uuid4()`` returned the same sequence of values in the
  parent and any children created using ``os.fork`` on Mac OS X 10.6.

- Issue #8313: ``traceback.format_exception_only()`` encodes unicode message to
  ASCII with backslashreplace error handler if ``str(value)`` failed.

- Issue #8567: Fix precedence of signals in Decimal module: when a Decimal
  operation raises multiple signals and more than one of those signals is
  trapped, the specification determines the order in which the signals should be
  handled.  In many cases this order wasn't being followed, leading to the wrong
  Python exception being raised.

- Issue #7865: The close() method of :mod:`io` objects should not swallow
  exceptions raised by the implicit flush().  Also ensure that calling close()
  several times is supported.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #8576: logging updated to remove usage of find_unused_port().

- Issue #4687: Fix accuracy of garbage collection runtimes displayed with
  gc.DEBUG_STATS.

- Issue #8354: The siginterrupt setting is now preserved for all signals, not
  just SIGCHLD.

- Issue #7192: ``webbrowser.get("firefox")`` now works on Mac OS X, as does
  ``webbrowser.get("safari")``.

- Issue #8577: ``distutils.sysconfig.get_python_inc()`` now makes a difference
  between the build dir and the source dir when looking for "python.h" or
  "Include".

- Issue #8464: tarfile no longer creates files with execute permissions set when
  mode="w|" is used.

- Issue #7834: Fix connect() of Bluetooth L2CAP sockets with recent versions of
  the Linux kernel.  Patch by Yaniv Aknin.

- Issue #6312: Fix http HEAD request when the transfer encoding is chunked.  It
  should correctly return an empty response now.

- Issue #7490: To facilitate sharing of doctests between 2.x and 3.x test
  suites, the ``IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL`` directive now also ignores the module
  location of the raised exception.  Based on initial patch by Lennart Regebro.

- Issue #8086: In :func:`ssl.DER_cert_to_PEM_cert()`, fix missing newline before
  the certificate footer.  Patch by Kyle VanderBeek.

- Issue #2302: Fix a race condition in SocketServer.BaseServer.shutdown, where
  the method could block indefinitely if called just before the event loop
  started running.  This also fixes the occasional freezes witnessed in
  test_httpservers.

- Issue #5103: SSL handshake would ignore the socket timeout and block
  indefinitely if the other end didn't respond.

- The do_handshake() method of SSL objects now adjusts the blocking mode of the
  SSL structure if necessary (as other methods already do).

- Issue #7507: Quote "!" in pipes.quote(); it is special to some shells.

- Issue #5238: Calling makefile() on an SSL object would prevent the underlying
  socket from being closed until all objects get truely destroyed.

- Issue #7943: Fix circular reference created when instantiating an SSL socket.
  Initial patch by Péter Szabó.

- Issue #8451: Syslog module now uses basename(sys.argv[0]) instead of the
  string "python" as the *ident*.  openlog() arguments are all optional and
  keywords.

- Issue #8108: Fix the unwrap() method of SSL objects when the socket has a
  non-infinite timeout.  Also make that method friendlier with applications
  wanting to continue using the socket in clear-text mode, by disabling
  OpenSSL's internal readahead.  Thanks to Darryl Miles for guidance.

- Issue #8484: Load all ciphers and digest algorithms when initializing the _ssl
  extension, such that verification of some SSL certificates doesn't fail
  because of an "unknown algorithm".

- Issue #8437: Fix test_gdb failures, patch written by Dave Malcolm

- Issue #4814: The timeout parameter is now applied also for connections
  resulting from PORT/EPRT commands.

- Issue #8463: Add missing reference to bztar in shutil's documentation.

- Issue #8438: Remove reference to the missing "surrogateescape" encoding error
  handler from the new IO library.

- Issue #3817: ftplib.FTP.abort() method now considers 225 a valid response code
  as stated in RFC-959 at chapter 5.4.

- Issue #8279: Fix test_gdb failures.

- Issue #8322: Add a *ciphers* argument to SSL sockets, so as to change the
  available cipher list.  Helps fix test_ssl with OpenSSL 1.0.0.

- Issue #2987: RFC 2732 support for urlparse (IPv6 addresses).  Patch by Tony
  Locke and Hans Ulrich Niedermann.

- Issue #7585: difflib context and unified diffs now place a tab between
  filename and date, conforming to the 'standards' they were originally designed
  to follow.  This improves compatibility with patch tools.

- Issue #7472: Fixed typo in email.encoders module; messages using ISO-2022
  character sets will now consistently use a Content-Transfer-Encoding of 7bit
  rather than sometimes being marked as 8bit.

- Issue #8330: Fix expected output in test_gdb.

- Issue #8374: Update the internal alias table in the :mod:`locale` module to
  cover recent locale changes and additions.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8644: Improved accuracy of ``timedelta.total_seconds()``.

- Use Clang 2.7's static analyzer to find places to clean up some code.

- Build the ossaudio extension on GNU/kFreeBSD.

- On Windows, ctypes does no longer check the stack before and after calling a
  foreign function.  This allows to use the unmodified libffi library.

Tests
-----

- Issue #8672: Add a zlib test ensuring that an incomplete stream can be handled
  by a decompressor object without errors (it returns incomplete uncompressed
  data).

- Issue #8490: asyncore now has a more solid test suite which actually tests its
  API.

- Issue #8576: Remove use of find_unused_port() in test_smtplib and
  test_multiprocessing.  Patch by Paul Moore.

- Issue #7449: Fix many tests to support Python compiled without thread support.
  Patches written by Jerry Seutter.

- Issue #8108: test_ftplib's non-blocking SSL server now has proper handling of
  SSL shutdowns.

Build
-----

- Issue #8625: Turn off optimization in ``--with-pydebug`` builds with gcc.
  (Optimization was unintentionally turned on in gcc --with-pydebug builds in
  2.7 beta1 as a result of the issue #1628484 fix, combined with autoconf's
  strange choice of default CFLAGS produced by AC_PROG_CC for gcc.)

- Issue #8509: Fix quoting in help strings and code snippets in configure.in.

- Issue #3646: It is now easily possible to install a Python framework into your
  home directory on Mac OS X, see Mac/README for more information.

- Issue #8510: Update to autoconf 2.65.

Misc
----

- Update the Vim syntax highlight file.


What's New in Python 2.7 beta 1?
================================

*Release date: 2010-04-10*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #7301: Add environment variable $PYTHONWARNINGS.

- Issue #8329: Don't return the same lists from select.select when no fds are
  changed.

- Issue #8259: ``1L << (2**31)`` no longer produces an 'outrageous shift error'
  on 64-bit machines.  The shift count for either left or right shift is
  permitted to be up to sys.maxsize.

- Ensure that tokenization of identifiers is not affected by locale.

- Issue #1222585: Added LDCXXSHARED for C++ support.  Patch by Arfrever.

- Raise a TypeError when trying to delete a T_STRING_INPLACE struct member.

- Issue #7994: Issue a PendingDeprecationWarning if object.__format__ is called
  with a non-empty format string. This is an effort to future-proof user
  code. If a derived class does not currently implement __format__ but later
  adds its own __format__, it would most likely break user code that had
  supplied a format string. This will be changed to a DeprecationWarning in
  Python 3.3 and it will be an error in Python 3.4.

- Issue #8268: Old-style classes (not just instances) now support weak
  references.

- Issue #8211: Save/restore CFLAGS around AC_PROG_CC in configure.in, in case it
  is set.

- Issue #1583863: An unicode subclass can now override the __unicode__ method

- Issue #6474: Make error message from passing an inadequate number of keyword
  arguments to a function correct.

- Issue #8164: Don't allow lambda functions to have a docstring.

- Issue #3137: Don't ignore errors at startup, especially a keyboard interrupt
  (SIGINT).  If an error occurs while importing the site module, the error is
  printed and Python exits.  Initialize the GIL before importing the site
  module.

- Code objects now support weak references.

Library
-------

- Issue #5277: Fix quote counting when parsing RFC 2231 encoded parameters.

- Issue #8321: Give access to OpenSSL version numbers from the `ssl` module,
  using the new attributes `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION`, `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO` and
  `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.

- Issue #8310: Allow dis to examine new style classes.

- Issue #8257: The Decimal construct now accepts a float instance directly,
  converting that float to a Decimal of equal value:

     >>> Decimal(1.1)
     Decimal('1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625')

- collections.Counter() now supports a subtract() method.

- The functools module now has a total_ordering() class decorator to simplify
  the specification of rich comparisons.

- The functools module also adds cmp_to_key() as a tool to transition old-style
  comparison functions to new-style key-functions.

- Issue #8294: The Fraction constructor now accepts Decimal and float instances
  directly.

- Issue #7279: Comparisons involving a Decimal signaling NaN now signal
  InvalidOperation instead of returning False.  (Comparisons involving a quiet
  NaN are unchanged.)  Also, Decimal quiet NaNs are now hashable; Decimal
  signaling NaNs remain unhashable.

- Issue #2531: Comparison operations between floats and Decimal instances now
  return a result based on the numeric values of the operands; previously they
  returned an arbitrary result based on the relative ordering of id(float) and
  id(Decimal).

- Issue #8233: When run as a script, py_compile.py optionally takes a single
  argument `-` which tells it to read files to compile from stdin.  Each line is
  read on demand and the named file is compiled immediately.  (Original patch by
  Piotr Ożarowski).

- Issue #3135: Add ``inspect.getcallargs()``, which binds arguments to a
  function like a normal call.

- Backwards incompatible change: Unicode codepoints line tabulation (0x0B) and
  form feed (0x0C) are now considered linebreaks, as specified in Unicode
  Standard Annex #14.  See issue #7643.  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/

- Comparisons using one of <, <=, >, >= between a complex instance and a
  Fractions instance now raise TypeError instead of returning True/False.  This
  makes Fraction <=> complex comparisons consistent with int <=> complex, float
  <=> complex, and complex <=> complex comparisons.

- Addition of ``WeakSet`` to the ``weakref`` module.

- logging: Added LOG_FTP to SysLogHandler and updated documentation.

- Issue #8205: Remove the "Modules" directory from sys.path when Python is
  running from the build directory (POSIX only).

- Issue #7667: Fix doctest failures with non-ASCII paths.

- Issue #7512: shutil.copystat() could raise an OSError when the filesystem
  didn't support chflags() (for example ZFS under FreeBSD).  The error is now
  silenced.

- Issue #7703: ctypes supports both buffer() and memoryview().  The former is
  deprecated.

- Issue #7860: platform.uname now reports the correct 'machine' type when Python
  is running in WOW64 mode on 64 bit Windows.

- logging: Added getChild utility method to Logger and added isEnabledFor method
  to LoggerAdapter.

- Issue #8201: logging: Handle situation of non-ASCII and Unicode logger names
  existing at the same time, causing a Unicode error when configuration code
  attempted to sort the existing loggers.

- Issue #8200: logging: Handle errors when multiprocessing is not fully loaded
  when logging occurs.

- Issue #3890, #8222: Fix recv() and recv_into() on non-blocking SSL sockets.
  Also, enable the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag on SSL sockets, so that blocking
  reads and writes are always retried by OpenSSL itself.

- Issue #8179: Fix macpath.realpath() on a non-existing path.

- Issue #8024: Update the Unicode database to 5.2.

- Issue #8104: socket.recv_into() and socket.recvfrom_into() now support writing
  into objects supporting the new buffer API, for example bytearrays or
  memoryviews.

- Issue #4961: Inconsistent/wrong result of askyesno function in tkMessageBox
  with Tcl/Tk-8.5.

- Issue #8140: Extend compileall to compile single files.  Add -i option.

- Issue #7356: ctypes.util: Make parsing of ldconfig output independent of the
  locale.

- Issue #7774: Set sys.executable to an empty string if ``argv[0]`` has been set
  to an non existent program name and Python is unable to retrieve the real
  program name.

- Issue #8117: logging: Improved algorithm for computing initial rollover time
  for ``TimedRotatingFileHandler`` by using the modification time of an existing
  log file to compute the next rollover time.  If the log file does not exist,
  the current time is used as the basis for the computation.

- Issue #6472: The ``xml.etree`` package is updated to ElementTree 1.3.  The
  cElementTree module is updated too.

- Issue #7880: Fix sysconfig when the python executable is a symbolic link.

- Issue #7624: Fix ``isinstance(foo(), collections.Callable)`` for old-style
  classes.

- Issue #7143: email: ``get_payload()`` used to strip any trailing newline from
  a base64 transfer-encoded payload *after* decoding it; it no longer does.
  This is a behavior change, so email's minor version number is now bumped, to
  version 4.0.2, for the 2.7 release.

- Issue #8235: _socket: Add the constant ``SO_SETFIB``.  SO_SETFIB is
  a socket option available on FreeBSD 7.1 and newer.

- Issue #8038: unittest.TestCase.assertNotRegexpMatches

- Addition of -b command line option to unittest for buffering stdout / stderr
  during test runs.

- Issue #1220212: Added os.kill support for Windows, including support for
  sending CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK events to console subprocesses.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8314: Fix unsigned long long bug in libffi on Sparc v8.

- Issue #1039, #8154: Fix os.execlp() crash with missing 2nd argument.

- Issue #8156: bsddb module updated to version 4.8.4.
  http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm#bsddb3-4.8.4.  This update drops
  support for Berkeley DB 4.0, and adds support for 4.8.

- Issue #3928: os.mknod() now available in Solaris, also.

- Issue #8142: Update libffi to the 3.0.9 release.

- Issue #8300: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with any
  integer format code, struct.pack first attempts to convert the non-integer
  using its __index__ method.  If that method is non-existent or raises
  TypeError it goes on to try the __int__ method, as described below.

- Issue #1530559: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with *any*
  integer format code (one of 'bBhHiIlLqQ'), struct.pack attempts to use the
  argument's __int__ method to convert to an integer before packing.  It also
  produces a DeprecationWarning in this case.  (In Python 2.6, the behaviour was
  inconsistent: __int__ was used for some integer codes but not for others, and
  the set of integer codes for which it was used differed between native packing
  and standard packing.)

- Issue #7347: _winreg: Add CreateKeyEx and DeleteKeyEx, as well as fix a bug in
  the return value of QueryReflectionKey.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #7993: Add a test of IO packet processing bandwidth to ccbench.  It
  measures the number of UDP packets processed per second depending on the
  number of background CPU-bound Python threads.

- python-config now supports multiple options on the same command line.

Build
-----

- Issue #8032: For gdb7, a python-gdb.py file is added to the build, allowing to
  use advanced gdb features when debugging Python.

- Issue #1628484: The Makefile doesn't ignore the CFLAGS environment variable
  anymore.  It also forwards the LDFLAGS settings to the linker when building a
  shared library.

- Issue #6716: Quote -x arguments of compileall in MSI installer.

- Issue #7705: Fix linking on FreeBSD.

- Make sure that the FreeBSD build of the included libffi uses the proper
  assembly file.

C-API
-----

- Issue #8276: PyEval_CallObject() is now only available in macro form.  The
  function declaration, which was kept for backwards compatibility reasons, is
  now removed (the macro was introduced in 1997!).

- Issue #7992: A replacement PyCObject API, PyCapsule, has been backported from
  Python 3.1.  All existing Python CObjects in the main distribution have been
  converted to capsules.  To address backwards-compatibility concerns,
  PyCObject_AsVoidPtr() was changed to understand capsules.

Tests
-----

- Issue #3864: Skip three test_signal tests on freebsd6 because they fail if any
  thread was previously started, most likely due to a platform bug.

- Issue #8348: Fix test ftp url in test_urllib2net.

- Issue #8204: Fix test_ttk notebook test by forcing focus.

- Issue #8344: Fix test_ttk bug on FreeBSD.

- Issue #8193: Fix test_zlib failure with zlib 1.2.4.

- Issue #8248: Add some tests for the bool type.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

- Issue #8263: Now regrtest.py will report a failure if it receives a
  KeyboardInterrupt (SIGINT).

- Issue #8180 and #8207: Fix test_pep277 on OS X and add more tests for special
  Unicode normalization cases.

- Issue #7783: test.test_support.open_urlresource invalidates the outdated files
  from the local cache.

  Xicluna who helped with the patch.

Build
-----

- Issue #3920, #7903: Define _BSD_SOURCE on OpenBSD 4.4 through 4.9.


What's New in Python 2.7 alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 2010-02-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #5677: Explicitly forbid write operations on read-only file objects,
  and read operations on write-only file objects.  On Windows, the system C
  library would return a bogus result; on Solaris, it was possible to crash the
  interpreter.  Patch by Stefan Krah.

- Issue #7853: Normalize exceptions before they are passed to a context
  manager's ``__exit__()`` method.

- Issue #7385: Fix a crash in ``PyMemoryView_FromObject()`` when
  ``PyObject_GetBuffer()`` fails.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7819: Check ``sys.call_tracing()`` arguments types.

- Issue #7788: Fix an interpreter crash produced by deleting a list slice with
  very large step value.

- Issue #7766: Change ``sys.getwindowsversion()`` return value to a named tuple
  and add the additional members returned in an OSVERSIONINFOEX structure.  The
  new members are service_pack_major, service_pack_minor, suite_mask, and
  product_type.

- Issue #7561: Operations on empty bytearrays (such as ``int(bytearray())``)
  could crash in many places because of the ``PyByteArray_AS_STRING()`` macro
  returning NULL.  The macro now returns a statically allocated empty string
  instead.

- Issue #7622: Improve the split(), rsplit(), splitlines() and replace()
  methods of bytes, bytearray and unicode objects by using a common
  implementation based on stringlib's fast search.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7632: Fix various str -> float conversion bugs present in 2.7 alpha 2,
  including:

  (1) a serious 'wrong output' bug that could occur for long (> 40 digit) input
      strings,
  (2) a crash in dtoa.c that occurred in debug builds when parsing certain long
      numeric strings corresponding to subnormal values,
  (3) a memory leak for some values large enough to cause overflow, and
  (4) a number of flaws that could lead to incorrectly rounded results.

- Issue #7319, #7770: Silence ``DeprecationWarning`` by default when the -3
  option is not used.

- Issue #2335: Backport set literals syntax from Python 3.x.

- Issue #2333: Backport set and dict comprehensions syntax from Python 3.x.

- Issue #1967: Backport dictionary views from Python 3.x.

Library
-------

- Issue #9137: Fix issue in MutableMapping.update, which incorrectly
  treated keyword arguments called 'self' or 'other' specially.

- Issue #7835: shelve should no longer produce mysterious warnings during
  interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #2746: Don't escape ampersands and angle brackets ("&", "<", ">") in
  XML processing instructions and comments.  These raw characters are allowed
  by the XML specification, and are necessary when outputting e.g.  PHP code in
  a processing instruction.  Patch by Neil Muller.

- Issue #7869: logging: Improved diagnostic for format-time errors.

- Issue #7868: logging: Added loggerClass attribute to Manager.

- Issue #7851: logging: Clarification on logging configuration files.

- Issue #4772: Raise a ValueError when an unknown Bluetooth protocol is
  specified, rather than fall through to AF_PACKET (in the ``socket`` module).
  Also, raise ValueError rather than TypeError when an unknown TIPC address
  type is specified.  Patch by Brian Curtin.

- logging: Implemented PEP 391.

- Issue #6939: Fix file I/O objects in the `io` module to keep the original
  file position when calling `truncate()`.  It would previously change the file
  position to the given argument, which goes against the tradition of
  ftruncate() and other truncation APIs.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #7610: Reworked implementation of the internal ``zipfile.ZipExtFile``
  class used to represent files stored inside an archive.  The new
  implementation is significantly faster and can be wrapped in a
  ``io.BufferedReader`` object for more speedups.  It also solves an issue
  where interleaved calls to ``read()`` and ``readline()`` give wrong results.
  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Issue #7792: Registering non-classes to ABCs raised an obscure error.

- Removed the deprecated functions ``verify()`` and ``vereq()`` from
  Lib/test/test_support.py.

- Issue #7773: Fix an UnboundLocalError in ``platform.linux_distribution()``
  when the release file is empty.

- Issue #7748: Since unicode values are supported for some metadata options in
  Distutils, the DistributionMetadata get_* methods will now return an utf-8
  encoded string for them.  This ensures that the upload and register commands
  send the correct values to PyPI without any error.

- Issue #1670765: Prevent ``email.generator.Generator`` from re-wrapping
  headers in multipart/signed MIME parts, which fixes one of the sources of
  invalid modifications to such parts by Generator.

- Issue #7701: Fix crash in ``binascii.b2a_uu()`` in debug mode when given a
  1-byte argument.  Patch by Victor Stinner.

- Issue #3299: Fix possible crash in the _sre module when given bad argument
  values in debug mode.  Patch by Victor Stinner.

- Issue #7703: Add support for the new buffer API to functions of the binascii
  module.  Backported from py3k by Florent Xicluna, with some additional tests.

- Issue #2846: Add support for gzip.GzipFile reading zero-padded files.  Patch
  by Brian Curtin.

- Issue #5827: Make sure that normpath preserves unicode.  Initial patch by
  Matt Giuca.

- Issue #5372: Drop the reuse of .o files in Distutils' ccompiler (since
  Extension extra options may change the output without changing the .c file).
  Initial patch by Collin Winter.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Expat: Fix DoS via XML document with malformed UTF-8 sequences
  (CVE_2009_3560).

Build
-----

- Issue #7632: When Py_USING_MEMORY_DEBUGGER is defined, disable the private

  instead.  Also disable caching of powers of 5.

- Issue #7658: Ensure that the new pythonw executable works on OSX 10.4

- Issue #7714: Use ``gcc -dumpversion`` to detect the version of GCC on
  MacOSX.

- Issue #7661: Allow ctypes to be built from a non-ASCII directory path.
  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- iobench (a file I/O benchmark) and ccbench (a concurrency benchmark) were
  added to the ``Tools`` directory.  They were previously living in the
  sandbox.

Tests
-----

- issue #7728: test_timeout was changed to use ``test_support.bind_port()``
  instead of a hard coded port.

Documentation
-------------

- Updated "Using Python" documentation to include description of CPython's -J,
  -U and -X options.

- Updated Python manual page (options -B, -O0, -s, environment variables
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE, PYTHONNOUSERSITE).

-----------------

- The ``__complex__()`` method is now looked up on the class of instances to
  make it consistent with other special methods.

- Issue #7462: Implement the stringlib fast search algorithm for the `rfind`,
  `rindex`, `rsplit` and `rpartition` methods.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #5080: A number of functions and methods previously produced a
  DeprecationWarning when passed a float argument where an integer was expected.
  These functions and methods now raise TypeError instead.  The majority of the
  effects of this change are in the extension modules, but some core functions
  and methods are affected: notably the 'chr', 'range' and 'xrange' builtins,
  and many unicode/str methods.

- Issue #7604: Deleting an unset slotted attribute did not raise an
  AttributeError.

- Issue #7534: Fix handling of IEEE specials (infinities, nans, negative zero)
  in ** operator.  The behaviour now conforms to that described in C99 Annex F.

- Issue #7579: The msvcrt module now has docstrings for all its functions.

- Issue #7413: Passing '\0' as the separator to datetime.datetime.isoformat()
  used to drop the time part of the result.

- Issue #1811: Improve accuracy and cross-platform consistency for true division
  of integers: the result of a/b is now correctly rounded for ints a and b (at
  least on IEEE 754 platforms), and in particular does not depend on the
  internal representation of a long.

- Issue #6108: ``unicode(exception)`` and ``str(exception)`` should return the
  same message when only ``__str__()`` (and not ``__unicode__()``) is overridden
  in the subclass.

- Issue #6834: Replace the implementation for the 'python' and 'pythonw'
  executables on OSX.

  These executables now work properly with the arch(1) command: ``arch -ppc
  python`` will start a universal binary version of python in PPC mode (unlike
  previous releases).

- Issue #1680159: Unicode coercion during an 'in' operation no longer masks the
  underlying error when the coercion fails for the left hand operand.

- Issue #7491: Metaclass's __cmp__ method was ignored.

- Issue #7466: Segmentation fault when the garbage collector is called in the
  middle of populating a tuple.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.


Library
-------

- Issue #6963: Added "maxtasksperchild" argument to ``multiprocessing.Pool``,
  allowing for a maximum number of tasks within the pool to be completed by the
  worker before that worker is terminated, and a new one created to replace it.

- Issue #7617: Make sure distutils.unixccompiler.UnixCCompiler recognizes gcc
  when it has a fully qualified configuration prefix.  Initial patch by
  Arfrever.

- Issue #7092: Remove py3k warning when importing cPickle.  2to3 handles
  renaming of `cPickle` to `pickle`.  The warning was annoying since there's no
  alternative to cPickle if you care about performance.  Patch by Florent
  Xicluna.

- Issue #7455: Fix possible crash in cPickle on invalid input.  Patch by Victor
  Stinner.

- Issue #7092: Fix the DeprecationWarnings emitted by the standard library when
  using the -3 flag.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7471: Improve the performance of GzipFile's buffering mechanism, and
  make it implement the ``io.BufferedIOBase`` ABC to allow for further speedups
  by wrapping it in an ``io.BufferedReader``.  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Issue #3972: ``httplib.HTTPConnection`` now accepts an optional source_address
  parameter to allow specifying where your connections come from.

- ``socket.create_connection()`` now accepts an optional source_address
  parameter.

- Issue #5511: ``zipfile.ZipFile`` can now be used as a context manager.
  Initial patch by Brian Curtin.

- Distutils now correctly identifies the build architecture as "x86_64" when
  building on OSX 10.6 without "-arch" flags.

- Issue #7556: Distutils' msvc9compiler now opens the MSVC Manifest file in text
  mode.

- Issue #7552: Removed line feed in the base64 Authorization header in the
  Distutils upload command to avoid an error when PyPI reads it.  This occurs on
  long passwords.  Initial patch by JP St. Pierre.

- Issue #7231: urllib2 cannot handle https with proxy requiring auth.  Patch by
  Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa.

- Issue #7349: Make methods of file objects in the io module accept None as an
  argument where file-like objects (ie StringIO and BytesIO) accept them to mean
  the same as passing no argument.

- Issue #7348: ``StringIO.StringIO.readline(-1)`` now acts as if it got no
  argument like other file objects.

- Issue #7357: tarfile no longer suppresses fatal extraction errors by default.

- Issue #7470: logging: Fix bug in Unicode encoding fallback.

- Issue #5949: Fixed IMAP4_SSL hang when the IMAP server response is missing
  proper end-of-line termination.

- Issue #7457: Added a read_pkg_file method to
  ``distutils.dist.DistributionMetadata``.

- Issue #3745: Undo the 2.7a1 change to have hashlib to reject unicode and non
  buffer API supporting objects as input.  That behavior is for 3.x only.

C-API
-----

- Issue #7767: New function ``PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow()`` added, analogous
  to ``PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow()``.

- Issue #5080: The argument parsing functions ``PyArg_ParseTuple()``,
  ``PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords()``, ``PyArg_VaParse()``,
  ``PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords()`` and ``PyArg_Parse()`` no longer accept
  float arguments for integer format codes (other than 'L'): previously an
  attempt to pass a float resulted in a DeprecationWarning; now it gives a
  TypeError.  For the 'L' format code (which previously had no warning) there is
  now a DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #7033: Function ``PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc()`` added.

Build
-----

- Issue #6491: Allow --with-dbmliborder to specify that no dbms will be built.

- Issue #6943: Use pkg-config to find the libffi headers when the
  ``--with-system-ffi`` flag is used.

- Issue #7609: Add a ``--with-system-expat`` option that causes the system's
  expat library to be used for the pyexpat module instead of the one included
  with Python.

- Issue #7589: Only build the nis module when the correct header files are
  found.

- Switch to OpenSSL 0.9.8l and sqlite 3.6.21 on Windows.

- Issue #7541: when using ``python-config`` with a framework install the
  compiler might use the wrong library.

Tests
-----

- Issue #7376: Instead of running a self-test (which was failing) when called
  with no arguments, doctest.py now gives a usage message.

- Issue #7396: Fix regrtest -s, which was broken by the -j enhancement.

- Issue #7498: test_multiprocessing now uses test_support.find_unused_port
  instead of a hardcoded port number in test_rapid_restart.


What's New in Python 2.7 alpha 1
================================

*Release date: 2009-12-05*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #7419: ``locale.setlocale()`` could crash the interpreter on Windows
  when called with invalid values.

- Issue #3382: 'F' formatting for float and complex now convert the result to
  upper case.  This only affects 'inf' and 'nan', since 'f' no longer converts
  to 'g' for large values.

- Remove switch from "%f" formatting to "%g" formatting for floats larger than
  1e50 in absolute value.

- Remove restrictions on precision when formatting floats.  E.g., "%.120g" %
  1e-100 used to raise OverflowError, but now gives the requested 120
  significant digits instead.

- Add Py3k warnings for parameter names in parentheses.

- Issue #7362: Give a proper error message for ``def f((x)=3): pass``.

- Issue #7085: Fix crash when importing some extensions in a thread on MacOSX
  10.6.

- Issue #7117: ``repr(x)`` for a float x returns a result based on the shortest
  decimal string that's guaranteed to round back to x under correct rounding
  (with round-half-to-even rounding mode).  Previously it gave a string based on
  rounding x to 17 decimal digits.  repr(x) for a complex number behaves
  similarly.  On platforms where the correctly-rounded strtod and dtoa code is
  not supported (see below), repr is unchanged.

- Issue #7117: On almost all platforms: float-to-string and string-to-float
  conversions within Python are now correctly rounded.  Places these conversions
  occur include: str for floats and complex numbers; the float and complex
  constructors; old-style and new-style numeric formatting; serialization and
  deserialization of floats and complex numbers using marshal, pickle and json;
  parsing of float and imaginary literals in Python code; Decimal-to-float
  conversion.

  The conversions use a Python-adapted version of David Gay's well-known dtoa.c,
  providing correctly-rounded strtod and dtoa C functions.  This code is
  supported on Windows, and on Unix-like platforms using gcc, icc or suncc as
  the C compiler.  There may be a small number of platforms on which correct
  operation of this code cannot be guaranteed, so the code is not used: notably,
  this applies to platforms where the C double format is not IEEE 754 binary64,
  and to platforms on x86 hardware where the x87 FPU is set to 64-bit precision
  and Python's configure script is unable to determine how to change the FPU
  precision.  On these platforms conversions use the platform strtod and dtoa,
  as before.

- Issue #7117: Backport round implementation from Python 3.x.  ``round()`` now
  uses the correctly-rounded string <-> float conversions described above (when
  available), and so produces correctly rounded results that will display nicely
  under the float repr.  There are two related small changes: (1) round now
  accepts any class with an ``__index__()`` method for its second argument (but
  no longer accepts floats for the second argument), and (2) an excessively
  large second integer argument (e.g., ``round(1.234, 10**100)``) no longer
  raises an exception.

- Issue #1757126: Fix the cyrillic-asian alias for the ptcp154 encoding.

- Fix several issues with ``compile()``.  The input can now contain Windows and
  Mac newlines and is no longer required to end in a newline.

- Remove length limitation when constructing a complex number from a unicode
  string.

- Issue #7244: ``itertools.izip_longest()`` no longer ignores exceptions raised
  during the formation of an output tuple.

- Issue #1087418: Boost performance of bitwise operations for longs.

- Issue #1722344: ``threading._shutdown()`` is now called in ``Py_Finalize()``,
  which fixes the problem of some exceptions being thrown at shutdown when the
  interpreter is killed.  Patch by Adam Olsen.

- Issue #7168: Document ``PyFloat_AsString()`` and ``PyFloat_AsReprString()``,
  and note that they are unsafe and deprecated.

- Issue #7120: logging: Remove import of multiprocessing which is causing crash
  in GAE.

- Issue #7140: The ``__dict__`` of a module should not be cleared unless the
  module is the only object holding a reference to it.

- Issue #1754094: Improve the stack depth calculation in the compiler.  There
  should be no other effect than a small decrease in memory use.  Patch by
  Christopher Tur Lesniewski-Laas.

- Issue #7084: Fix a (very unlikely) crash when printing a list from one thread,
  and mutating it from another one.  Patch by Scott Dial.

- Issue #1571184: The Unicode database contains properties for more characters.
  The tables for code points representing numeric values, white spaces or line
  breaks are now generated from the official Unicode Character Database files,
  and include information from the Unihan.txt file.

- Issue #7050: Fix a SystemError when trying to use unpacking and augmented
  assignment.

- Issue #5329: Fix ``os.popen*`` regression from 2.5 with commands as a sequence
  running through the shell.  Patch by Jean-Paul Calderone and Jani Hakala.

- Issue #7019: Raise ValueError when unmarshalling bad long data, instead of
  producing internally inconsistent Python longs.

- Issue #6990: Fix ``threading.local`` subclasses leaving old state around after
  a reference cycle GC which could be recycled by new locals.

- Issue #6300: unicode.encode, unicode.decode, str.decode, and str.encode now
  take keyword arguments.

- Issue #6922: Fix an infinite loop when trying to decode an invalid UTF-32
  stream with a non-raising error handler like "replace" or "ignore".

- Issue #6713: Improve performance of base 10 int -> string and long -> string
  conversions.

- Issue #1590864: Fix potential deadlock when mixing threads and fork().

- Issue #6844: Do not emit DeprecationWarnings when accessing a "message"
  attribute on exceptions that was set explicitly.

- Issue #6846: Fix bug where bytearray.pop() returns negative integers.

- ``classmethod()`` no longer checks if its argument is callable.

- Issue #6750: A text file opened with ``io.open()`` could duplicate its output
  when writing from multiple threads at the same time.

- Issue #6704: Improve the col_offset in AST for "for" statements with a target
  of tuple unpacking.

- Issue #6707: ``dir()`` on an uninitialized module caused a crash.

- Issue #6540: Fixed crash for ``bytearray.translate()`` with invalid parameters.

- Issue #6573: ``set.union()`` stopped processing inputs if an instance of self
  occurred in the argument chain.

- Issue #1616979: Added the cp720 (Arabic DOS) encoding.

- Issue #6070: On posix platforms import no longer copies the execute bit from
  the .py file to the .pyc file if it is set.  Patch by Marco N.

- Issue #4618: When unicode arguments are passed to ``print()``, the default
  separator and end should be unicode also.

- Issue #6119: Fixed an incorrect Py3k warning about order comparisons of
  built-in functions and methods.

- Issue #6347: Include inttypes.h as well as stdint.h in pyport.h.  This fixes a
  build failure on HP-UX: int32_t and uint32_t are defined in inttypes.h instead
  of stdint.h on that platform.

- Issue #4856: Remove checks for win NT.

- Issue #2016: Fixed a crash in a corner case where the dictionary of keyword
  arguments could be modified during the function call setup.

- Removed the ipaddr module.

- Issue #6329: Fixed iteration for memoryview objects (it was being blocked
  because it wasn't recognized as a sequence).

- Issue #6289: Encoding errors from ``compile()`` were being masked.

- When no module is given in a relative import, the module field of the
  ImportFrom AST node is now None instead of an empty string.

- Assignment to None using import statements now raises a SyntaxError.

- Issue #4547: When debugging a very large function, it was not always possible
  to update the lineno attribute of the current frame.

- Issue #5330: C functions called with keyword arguments were not reported by
  the various profiling modules (profile, cProfile).  Patch by Hagen Fürstenau.

- Issue #5982: staticmethod and classmethod now expose the wrapped function with
  ``__func__``.

- Added support for multiple context managers in the same with-statement.
  Deprecated ``contextlib.nested()`` which is no longer needed.

- Issue #6101: A new opcode, SETUP_WITH, has been added to speed up the with
  statement and correctly lookup the __enter__ and __exit__ special methods.

- Issue #5829: complex("1e500") no longer raises OverflowError.  This makes it
  consistent with float("1e500") and interpretation of real and imaginary
  literals.

- Issue #3527: Removed Py_WIN_WIDE_FILENAMES which is not used any more.

- ``__instancecheck__()`` and ``__subclasscheck__()`` are now completely ignored
  on classic classes and instances.

- Issue #5994: The marshal module now has docstrings.

- Issue #5981: Fix three minor inf/nan issues in float.fromhex:

  (1) inf and nan strings with trailing whitespace were incorrectly rejected;
  (2) parsing of strings representing infinities and nans was locale aware; and
  (3) the interpretation of fromhex('-nan') didn't match that of float('-nan').

- Issue #5920: For ``float.__format__()``, change the behavior with the empty
  presentation type (that is, not one of 'e', 'f', 'g', or 'n') to be like 'g'
  but with at least one decimal point and with a default precision
  of 12. Previously, the behavior the same but with a default precision of 6.
  This more closely matches ``str()``, and reduces surprises when adding
  alignment flags to the empty presentation type. This also affects the new
  complex.__format__ in the same way.

- Issue #5890: In subclasses of 'property' the __doc__ attribute was shadowed by
  classtype's, even if it was None.  property now inserts the __doc__ into the
  subclass instance __dict__.

- Issue #4426: The UTF-7 decoder was too strict and didn't accept some legal
  sequences.  Patch by Nick Barnes and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #1588: Add complex.__format__. For example, ``format(complex(1, 2./3),
  '.5')`` now produces a sensible result.

- Issue #5864: Fix empty format code formatting for floats so that it never
  gives more than the requested number of significant digits.

- Issue #5793: Rationalize isdigit / isalpha / tolower, etc. Includes new
  Py_ISDIGIT / Py_ISALPHA / Py_TOLOWER, etc. in pctypes.h.

- Issue #4971: Fix titlecase for characters that are their own titlecase, but
  not their own uppercase.

- Issue #5835: Deprecate PyOS_ascii_formatd and replace it with
  _PyOS_double_to_string or PyOS_double_to_string.

- Issue #5283: Setting __class__ in __del__ caused a segfault.

- Issue #5816: ``complex(repr(z))`` now recovers z exactly, even when z involves
  nans, infs or negative zeros.

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for floats, ints,
  and longs.

- Issue #5515: 'n' formatting for ints, longs, and floats handles leading zero
  formatting poorly.

- Issue #5772: For float.__format__, don't add a trailing ".0" if we're using no
  type code and we have an exponent.

- Issue #3166: Make long -> float (and int -> float) conversions correctly
  rounded.

- Issue #5787: ``object.__getattribute__(some_type, "__bases__")`` segfaulted on
  some built-in types.

- Issue #1869: Fix a couple of minor round() issues.  ``round(5e15+1)`` was
  giving 5e15+2; ``round(-0.0)`` was losing the sign of the zero.

- Issue #5759: float() didn't call __float__ on str subclasses.

- Issue #5704: The "-3" command-line option now implies "-t".

- Issue #2170: Refactored ``xml.dom.minidom.normalize``, increasing both its
  clarity and its speed.

- Issue #2396: The memoryview object was backported from Python 3.1.

- Fix a problem in PyErr_NormalizeException that leads to "undetected errors"
  when hitting the recursion limit under certain circumstances.

- Issue #1665206: Remove the last eager import in _warnings.c and make it lazy.

- Issue #4865: On MacOSX /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages is added to the end
  sys.path, for compatibility with the system install of Python.

- Issue #4688: Add a heuristic so that tuples and dicts containing only
  untrackable objects are not tracked by the garbage collector. This can reduce
  the size of collections and therefore the garbage collection overhead on
  long-running programs, depending on their particular use of datatypes.

- Issue #5512: Rewrite PyLong long division algorithm (x_divrem) to improve its
  performance.  Long divisions and remainder operations are now between 50% and
  150% faster.

- Issue #4258: Make it possible to use base 2**30 instead of base 2**15 for the
  internal representation of integers, for performance reasons.  Base 2**30 is
  enabled by default on 64-bit machines.  Add --enable-big-digits option to
  configure, which overrides the default.  Add sys.long_info structseq to
  provide information about the internal format.

- Issue #4034: Fix weird attribute error messages of the traceback object. (As a
  result traceback.__members__ no longer exists.)

- Issue #4474: PyUnicode_FromWideChar now converts characters outside the BMP to
  surrogate pairs, on systems with sizeof(wchar_t) == 4 and sizeof(Py_UNICODE)
  == 2.

- Issue #5237: Allow auto-numbered fields in str.format(). For example: ``'{}
  {}'.format(1, 2) == '1 2'``.

- Issue #3652: Make the 'line' argument for ``warnings.showwarning()`` a
  requirement.  Means the DeprecationWarning from Python 2.6 can go away.

- Issue #5247: Improve error message when unknown format codes are used when
  using ``str.format()`` with str, unicode, long, int, and float arguments.

- Running Python with the -3 option now also warns about classic division for
  ints and longs.

- Issue #5260: Long integers now consume less memory: average saving is 2 bytes
  per long on a 32-bit system and 6 bytes per long on a 64-bit system.

- Issue #5186: Reduce hash collisions for objects with no __hash__ method by
  rotating the object pointer by 4 bits to the right.

- Issue #4575: Fix Py_IS_INFINITY macro to work correctly on x87 FPUs: it now
  forces its argument to double before testing for infinity.

- Issue #4978: Passing keyword arguments as unicode strings is now allowed.

- Issue #1242657: the __len__() and __length_hint__() calls in several tools
  were suppressing all exceptions.  These include list(), filter(), map(),
  zip(), and bytearray().

- os.ftruncate raises OSErrors instead of IOErrors for consistency with other os
  functions.

- Issue #4991: Passing invalid file descriptors to io.FileIO now raises an
  OSError.

- Issue #4807: Port the _winreg module to Windows CE.

- Issue #4935: The overflow checking code in the expandtabs() method common to
  str, bytes and bytearray could be optimized away by the compiler, letting the
  interpreter segfault instead of raising an error.

- Issue #3720: Fix a crash when an iterator modifies its class and removes its
  __next__ method.

- Issue #4893: Use NT threading on CE.

- Issue #4915: Port sysmodule to Windows CE.

- Issue #4074: Change the criteria for doing a full garbage collection (i.e.
  collecting the oldest generation) so that allocating lots of objects without
  destroying them does not show quadratic performance. Based on a proposal by
  Martin von Löwis at
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-June/080579.html.

- Issue #4850: Change COUNT_ALLOCS variables to Py_ssize_t.

- Issue #1180193: When importing a module from a .pyc (or .pyo) file with an
  existing .py counterpart, override the co_filename attributes of all code
  objects if the original filename is obsolete (which can happen if the file has
  been renamed, moved, or if it is accessed through different paths).  Patch by
  Ziga Seilnacht and Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #4075: Use ``OutputDebugStringW()`` in Py_FatalError.

- Issue #4797: IOError.filename was not set when _fileio.FileIO failed to open
  file with `str' filename on Windows.

- Issue #3680: Reference cycles created through a dict, set or deque iterator
  did not get collected.

- Issue #4701: PyObject_Hash now implicitly calls PyType_Ready on types where
  the tp_hash and tp_dict slots are both NULL.

- Issue #4764: With io.open, IOError.filename is set when trying to open a
  directory on POSIX systems.

- Issue #4764: IOError.filename is set when trying to open a directory on POSIX
  systems.

- Issue #4759: None is now allowed as the first argument of
  ``bytearray.translate()``.  It was always allowed for ``bytes.translate()``.

- Added test case to ensure attempts to read from a file opened for writing
  fail.

- Issue #2467: gc.DEBUG_STATS reported invalid elapsed times. Also, always print
  elapsed times, not only when some objects are uncollectable/unreachable.
  Original patch by Neil Schemenauer.

- Issue #3439: Add a bit_length method to int and long.

- Issue #2183: Simplify and optimize bytecode for list comprehensions.  Original
  patch by Neal Norwitz.

- Issue #4597: Fixed exception handling when the __exit__ function of a context
  manager returns a value that cannot be converted to a bool.

- Issue #4597: Fixed several opcodes that weren't always propagating exceptions.

- Issue #4445: Replace ``sizeof(PyStringObject)`` with
  ``offsetof(PyStringObject, ob_sval) + 1`` when allocating memory for str
  instances.  On a typical machine this saves 3 bytes of memory (on average) per
  string allocation.

- Issue #3996: On Windows, the PyOS_CheckStack function would cause the
  interpreter to abort ("Fatal Python error: Could not reset the stack!")
  instead of throwing a MemoryError.

- Issue #3689: The list reversed iterator now supports __length_hint__ instead
  of __len__.  Behavior now matches other reversed iterators.

- Issue #4367: Python would segfault during compiling when the unicodedata
  module couldn't be imported and \N escapes were present.

- Issue #4233: Changed semantic of ``_fileio.FileIO``'s ``close()`` method on
  file objects with closefd=False. The file descriptor is still kept open but
  the file object behaves like a closed file. The ``FileIO`` object also got a
  new readonly attribute ``closefd``.

- Issue #4348: Some bytearray methods returned that didn't cause any change to
  the bytearray, returned the same bytearray instead of a copy.

- Issue #4317: Fixed a crash in the ``imageop.rgb2rgb8()`` function.

- Issue #4230: If ``__getattr__`` is a descriptor, it now functions correctly.

- Issue #4048: The parser module now correctly validates relative imports.

- Issue #4225: ``from __future__ import unicode_literals`` didn't work in an
  exec statement.

- Issue #4176: Fixed a crash when pickling an object which ``__reduce__`` method
  does not return iterators for the 4th and 5th items.

- Issue #4209: Enabling unicode_literals and the print_function in the same
  __future__ import didn't work.

- Using ``nonlocal`` as a variable name will now raise a Py3k SyntaxWarning
  because it is a reserved word in 3.x.

- On windows, ``os.chdir()`` given unicode was not working if
  GetCurrentDirectoryW returned a path longer than MAX_PATH. (But It's doubtful
  this code path is really executed because I cannot move to such directory on
  win2k)

- Issue #4069: When ``set.remove(element)`` is used with a set element, the
  element is temporarily replaced with an equivalent frozenset.  But the
  eventual KeyError would always report the empty ``frozenset()`` as the missing
  key.  Now it correctly refers to the initial element.

- Issue #4509: Various issues surrounding resize of bytearray objects to which
  there are buffer exports.

- Issue #4748: Lambda generators no longer return a value.

- Issue #3582: Use native TLS functions on Windows

- The re.sub(), re.subn() and re.split() functions now accept a flags parameter.

- Issue #3845: In PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags avoid invalid memory access with short
  file names.

- Issue #1113244: Py_XINCREF, Py_DECREF, Py_XDECREF: Add `do { ... } while (0)'
  to avoid compiler warnings.

- Issue #5705: os.setuid() would not accept values > 2**31-1 but pwd.getpwnam()
  returned them on 64bit platforms.

- Issue #5108: Handle %s like %S and %R in PyUnicode_FromFormatV(): Call
  PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8() once, remember the result and output it in a second
  step. This avoids problems with counting UTF-8 bytes that ignores the effect
  of using the replace error handler in PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8().

- Issue #3739: The unicode-internal encoder now reports the number of characters
  consumed like any other encoder (instead of the number of bytes).

- Issue #2422: When compiled with the ``--with-valgrind`` option, the pymalloc
  allocator will be automatically disabled when running under Valgrind.  This
  gives improved memory leak detection when running under Valgrind, while taking
  advantage of pymalloc at other times.

Library

  ctime of the files involved.

- Issue #5122: Synchronize tk load failure check to prevent a potential
  deadlock.

- Issue #1818: collections.namedtuple() now supports a keyword argument 'rename'
  which lets invalid fieldnames be automatically converted to positional names
  in the form, _1, _2, ...

- Issue #4890: Handle empty text search pattern in Tkinter.Text.search.

- Issue #5170: Fixed Unicode output bug in logging and added test case.  This is
  a regression which did not occur in 2.5.

- Issue #4512 (part 2): Promote ``ZipImporter._get_filename()`` to be a public
  documented method ``ZipImporter.get_filename()``.

- Issue #4195: The ``runpy`` module (and the ``-m`` switch) now support the

  directories to a zipfile.

- Issue #3807: _multiprocessing build fails when configure is passed
  --without-threads argument. When this occurs, _multiprocessing will be
  disabled, and not compiled.

- Issue #5008: When a file is opened in append mode with the new IO library, do
  an explicit seek to the end of file (so that e.g. tell() returns the file size
  rather than 0). This is consistent with the behaviour of the traditional 2.x
  file object.

- Issue #5013: Fixed a bug in FileHandler which occurred when the delay
  parameter was set.

- Issue #4998: The memory saving effect of __slots__ had been lost on Fractions
  which inherited from numbers.py which did not have __slots__ defined.  The
  numbers hierarchy now has its own __slots__ declarations.

- Issue #3321: _multiprocessing.Connection() doesn't check handle; added checks
  for *nix machines for negative handles and large int handles.  Without this
  check it is possible to segfault the interpreter.

- Issue #4449: AssertionError in mp_benchmarks.py, caused by an underlying issue
  in sharedctypes.py.

  Jacques Frechet.

- Restore Python 2.3 compatibility for decimal.py.

- Issue #1702551: distutils sdist was not excluding VCS directories under

  return encodes to more than one byte in the source encoding (e.g. UTF-16) and
  gets split on a chunk boundary.

- Issue #4223: inspect.getsource() will now correctly display source code for

  loader). Original patch by Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issue #4201: pdb can now access and display source code loaded via zipimport
  (or any other conformant PEP 302 loader).  Original patch by Alexander
  Belopolsky.

- Issue #4197: Doctests in modules loaded via zipimport (or any other PEP 302
  conformant loader) will now work correctly in most cases (they are still
  subject to the constraints that exist for all code running from inside a
  module loaded via a PEP 302 loader and attempting to perform IO operations
  based on __file__).  Original patch by Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issues #4082 and #4512: Add runpy support to zipimport in a manner that allows
  backporting to maintenance branches.  Original patch by Alexander Belopolsky.

  when given an unicode string.

- Issue #4616: TarFile.utime(): Restore directory times on Windows.

- Issue #4084: Fix max, min, max_mag and min_mag Decimal methods to give correct
  results in the case where one argument is a quiet NaN and the other is a
  finite number that requires rounding.

  arguments introduced in 2.5.

- Issue #5828 (Invalid behavior of unicode.lower): Fixed bogus logic in

  correctly under gcc on x86-64.  This fixes a reported problem with the
  --with-tsc build on x86-64.

- Add 2 new options to ``--with-universal-archs`` on MacOSX: ``intel`` builds a
  distribution with ``i386`` and ``x86_64`` architectures, while ``3-way``

  PyErr_Format, on machines with HAVE_LONG_LONG defined.

- Add new C-API function PyOS_string_to_double, and deprecated PyOS_ascii_atof
  and PyOS_ascii_strtod.

- Removed _PyOS_double_to_string. Use PyOS_double_to_string instead.  This is in
  preparation for (but not strictly related to) issue #7117, short float repr.

- Issue #6624: PyArg_ParseTuple with "s" format when parsing argument with NULL:
  Bogus TypeError detail string.

- Issue #5954: Add a PyFrame_GetLineNumber() function to replace most uses of
  PyCode_Addr2Line().

- Issue #5959: Add a PyCode_NewEmpty() function to create a new empty code
  object at a specified file, function, and line number.

- Issue #1419652: Change the first argument to PyImport_AppendInittab() to
  ``const char *`` as the string is stored beyond the call.

- Some PyBytes_* aliases have been removed because they don't exist in 3.x.

- Issue #5175: PyLong_AsUnsignedLongLong now raises OverflowError for negative
  arguments.  Previously, it raised TypeError.

- Issue #4720: The format for PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords can begin with '|'.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #6508: Add posix.{getresuid,getresgid,setresuid,setresgid}.

- Issue #7078: Set struct.__doc__ from _struct.__doc__.

- Issue #3366: Add erf, erfc, expm1, gamma, lgamma functions to math module.

- Issue #6823: Allow time.strftime() to accept a tuple with a isdst field
  outside of the range of [-1, 1] by normalizing the value to within that range.

- Issue #6877: Make it possible to link the readline extension to libedit on
  OSX.

- Issue #6944: Fix a SystemError when socket.getnameinfo() was called with
  something other than a tuple as first argument.

- Issue #6865: Fix reference counting issue in the initialization of the pwd
  module.

- Issue #6848: Fix curses module build failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fix a segfault in expat when given a specially crafted input lead to the
  tokenizer not stopping. CVE-2009-3720.

- Issue #6561: '\d' in a regex now matches only characters with Unicode category
  'Nd' (Number, Decimal Digit).  Previously it also matched characters with
  category 'No'.

- Issue #1523: Remove deprecated overflow wrapping for struct.pack with an
  integer format code ('bBhHiIlLqQ').  Packing an out-of-range integer now
  consistently raises struct.error.

- Issues #1530559, #1741130: Fix various struct.pack inconsistencies for the
  integer formats ('bBhHiIlLqQ').  In the following, '*' represents any of '=',
  '<', '>'.

    - Packing a float now always gives a Deprecation Warning.  Previously it
      only warned for 'I', 'L', '*B', '*H', '*I', '*L'.

    - If x is not an int, long or float, then packing x will always result in
      struct.error.  Previously an x with an __int__ method could be packed by
      'b', 'B', 'h', 'H', 'i', 'l', '*b', '*h' ,'*i', '*l', and an x with a
      __long__ method could be packed by 'q', 'Q', '*q', '*Q'; for x with
      neither __int__ nor __long__, TypeError used to be raised (with a
      confusing error message) for 'I', 'L', '*B', '*H', '*I', '*L', and
      struct.error in other cases.

  Note: as of Python 2.7 beta 1, the above is out of date.  In 2.7 beta 1, any
  argument with an __int__ method can be packed, but use of this feature
  triggers a DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #4873: Fix resource leaks in error cases of pwd and grp.

- Issue #4751: For hashlib algorithms provided by OpenSSL, the Python GIL is now
  released during computation on data lengths >= 2048 bytes.

- Issue #3745: Fix hashlib to always reject unicode and non buffer-api
  supporting objects as input no matter how it was compiled (built in
  implementations or external openssl library).  NOTE: Undone in 2.7a2.

- Issue #4397: Fix occasional test_socket failure on OS X.

- Issue #4279: Fix build of parsermodule under Cygwin.

- Issue #4051: Prevent conflict of UNICODE macros in cPickle.

- Issue #4228: Pack negative values the same way as 2.4 in struct's L format.

- Issue #1040026: Fix os.times result on systems where HZ is incorrect.

- Issues #3167, #3682: Fix test_math failures for log, log10 on Solaris,
  OpenBSD.

- Issue #4365: Add crtassem.h constants to the msvcrt module.

- Issue #4396: The parser module now correctly validates the with statement.

- Issue #5228: Make functools.partial objects can now be pickled.

Tests
-----

- Issue #7431: Use TESTFN in test_linecache instead of trying to create a file
  in the Lib/test directory, which might be read-only for the user running the
  tests.

- Issue #7324: Add a sanity check to regrtest argument parsing to catch the case
  of an option with no handler.

- Issue #7312: Add a -F flag to run the selected tests in a loop until a test
  fails.  Can be combined with -j.

- Issue #7295: Do not use a hardcoded file name in test_tarfile.

- Issue #7270: Add some dedicated unit tests for multi-thread synchronization
  primitives such as Lock, RLock, Condition, Event and Semaphore.

- Issue #7222: Make thread "reaping" more reliable so that reference
  leak-chasing test runs give sensible results.  The previous method of reaping
  threads could return successfully while some Thread objects were still
  referenced.  This also introduces a new private function: ``thread._count()``.

- Issue #7151: Fixed regrtest -j so that output to stderr from a test no longer
  runs the risk of causing the worker thread to fail.

- Issue #7055: test___all__ now greedily detects all modules which have an
  __all__ attribute, rather than using a hardcoded and incomplete list.

- Issue #7058: Added save/restore for things like sys.argv and cwd to
  runtest_inner in regrtest, with warnings if the called test modifies them,
  and a new section in the summary report at the end.

- Issue #7042: Fix test_signal (test_itimer_virtual) failure on OS X 10.6.

- Issue #6806: test_platform failed under OS X 10.6.0 because ``sw_ver`` leaves
  off the trailing 0 in the version number.

- Issue #5450: Moved tests involving loading tk from Lib/test/test_tcl to
  Lib/lib-tk/test/test_tkinter/test_loadtk. With this, these tests demonstrate
  the same behaviour as test_ttkguionly (and now also test_tk) which is to skip
  the tests if DISPLAY is defined but can't be used.

- Issue #6152: New option '-j'/'--multiprocess' for regrtest allows running
  regression tests in parallel, shortening the total runtime.

- Issue #5354: New test support function import_fresh_module() makes it easy to
  import both normal and optimised versions of modules.  test_heapq and
  test_warnings have been adjusted to use it, tests for other modules with both
  C and Python implementations in the stdlib can be adjusted to use it over
  time.

- Fix test_warnings to no longer reset the warnings filter.

- Fix test_logging to no longer reset the warnings filter.

- Issue #5635: Fix running test_sys with tracing enabled.

- regrtest no longer treats ImportError as equivalent to SkipTest.  Imports that
  should cause a test to be skipped are now done using import_module from test
  support, which does the conversion.

- Issue #5083: New 'gui' resource for regrtest.

- Issue #5837: Certain sequences of calls to set() and unset() for
  support.EnvironmentVarGuard objects restored the environment variables
  incorrectly on __exit__.

- Issue #2389: Array objects are now pickled in a portable manner.

Misc
----

- Issue #5611: Auto-detect whether a C file uses tabs or spaces in Vim.


What's New in Python 2.6 final
==============================

*Release date: 01-Oct-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3967: Fixed a crash in the count() and find() methods of string-like
  objects, when the "start" parameter is a huge value.

- Issue #3965: Fixed a crash on Windows when open() is given an invalid
  filename or mode, and the filename is a unicode string.

- Bug #3951: Py_USING_MEMORY_DEBUGGER should not be enabled by default.

Library
-------

- Issue #3965: Allow repeated calls to turtle.Screen, by making it a
  true singleton object.

- Issue #3895: It was possible to crash the interpreter when an external timer
  was used with cProfile that returned an object that could not be converted
  into a float.

- Issue #3950: Made turtle respect scale factors.

- Issue #3547: Fixed ctypes structures bitfields of varying integer
  sizes.

- Issue #3879: A regression in urllib.getproxies_enviroment was fixed.

- Issue #3863: Disabled a unit test of fork being called from a thread
  when running on platforms known to exhibit OS bugs when attempting that.

Build
-----

- Bug #3989: Package the 2to3 script (as 2to3.py) in the Windows
  installer.

- Bug #3887: Package x64 version of CRT for AMD64 Windows binaries.


What's New in Python 2.6 release candidate 2?
=============================================

*Release date: 17-Sep-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Security Issue #2: imageop did not validate arguments correctly and could
  segfault as a result.

- Issue #3886: Possible integer overflows in the _hashopenssl module were
  closed.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #3850: recursion tests in Tools/scripts/find_recursion_limit.py can raise
  AttributeError instead of RuntimeError, depending in which C API call
  exactly the recursion limit is exceeded. Consequently, both exception types
  are caught and silenced.

Build
-----

- Issue #3617: Include a licensing statement regarding the Microsoft
  C runtime in the Windows installer.


What's New in Python 2.6 release candidate 1?
=============================================

*Release date: 12-Sep-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3642: Suppress warning in obmalloc when size_t is larger than uint.

- Issue #3743: In a few places, PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T was incorrectly used with
  PyString_FromFormat or PyErr_Format to display size_t values. The macro
  PY_FORMAT_SIZE_T is designed to select the correct format for the OS
  ``printf`` function, whereas PyString_FromFormat has an independent
  implementation and uses "%zd" on all platforms for size_t values.
  This makes a difference on win64, where ``printf`` needs "%Id" to display
  64bit values.

- Issue #3634: _weakref.ref(Exception).__init__() gave invalid return value on
  error.

- Issue #3777: long() applied to a float object now always return a long
  object; previously an int would be returned for small values. the __long__
  method is allowed to return either an int or a long, but the behaviour of
  float objects should not change to respect backward compatibility.

- Issue #2534: speed up isinstance() and issubclass() by 50-70%, so as to
  match Python 2.5 speed despite the __instancecheck__ / __subclasscheck__
  mechanism. In the process, fix a bug where isinstance() and issubclass(),
  when given a tuple of classes as second argument, were looking up
  __instancecheck__ / __subclasscheck__ on the tuple rather than on each
  type object.

- Fix crashes on memory allocation failure found with failmalloc.

- Fix memory leaks found with valgrind and update suppressions file.

- Fix compiler warnings in opt mode which would lead to invalid memory reads.

- Fix problem using wrong name in decimal module reported by pychecker.

  ``__delslice__``.

- Issue #3678: Correctly pass LDFLAGS and LDLAST to the linker on shared
  library targets in the Makefile.

- Issue #1204: The configure script now tests for additional libraries
  that may be required when linking against readline.  This fixes issues
  with x86_64 builds on some platforms (a few Linux flavors and OpenBSD).

  path to the Python binary.

- Issue #3602: Moved test.test_support.catch_warning() to
  warnings.catch_warnings() along with some API cleanup. Expanding the tests
  for catch_warnings() also led to an improvement in the raising of a
  DeprecationWarning related to warnings.warn_explicit().

  with GNU build target guidelines.


What's New in Python 2.6 beta 3?
================================

*Release date: 20-Aug-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #1878: Remove Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG from
  Py_TPFLAGS_DEFAULT when not building the core.  This means 3rd party
  extensions do not automatically benefit from the class attribute
  cache; they will have to explicitly add Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VERSION_TAG
  to their tp_flags field if they care.  This is a backwards
  compatibility feature; in 3.0, all types will use the cache by
  default.

- Keyword arguments can now follow starred arguments. (``f(a, *args,
  keyword=23)`` is now valid syntax.)

- ctypes function pointers that are COM methods have a boolean True
  value again.

- Issue #3139: Make buffer-interface thread-safe wrt. PyArg_ParseTuple,
  by denying s# to parse objects that have a releasebuffer procedure,
  and introducing s*.

- Issue #3537: Fix an assertion failure when an empty but presized dict
  object was stored in the freelist.

- Issue #1481296: Make long(float('nan')) and int(float('nan')) raise
  ValueError consistently across platforms.

- Issue #3479: On platforms where sizeof(int) is smaller than sizeof(long)
  (64bit Unix, for example), unichr() would truncate its argument and return
  u'\x00' for unichr(2**32). Now it properly raises an OverflowError.

- Apply security patches from Apple.

- Issue #2542: Now that issubclass() may call arbitrary code, ensure that
  PyErr_ExceptionMatches returns 0 when an exception occurs there.

- Issue #1819: function calls with several named parameters are now on
  average 35% faster (as measured by pybench).

- Issue #2378: An unexpected UnboundLocalError or NameError could appear when
  the python debugger steps into a class statement: the free variables (local
  variables defined in an outer scope) would be deleted from the outer scope.

- Issue #2620: Overflow checking when allocating or reallocating memory
  was not always being done properly in some python types and extension
  modules.  PyMem_MALLOC, PyMem_REALLOC, PyMem_NEW and PyMem_RESIZE have
  all been updated to perform better checks and places in the code that
  would previously leak memory on the error path when such an allocation
  failed have been fixed.

Library
-------

- Issue #3612: Added some missing basic types in ctypes.wintypes.

- The methods ``is_in_tuple()``, ``is_vararg()``, and ``is_keywordarg()`` of
  symtable.Symbol have been deprecated for removal in 3.0 and the next release.

- Issue #2234: distutils failed for some versions of the cygwin compiler. The
  version reported by these tools does not necessarily follow the python
  version numbering scheme, so the module is less strict when parsing it.

- Issue #2235: Added Py3k warnings for types which will become unhashable
  under the stricter __hash__ inheritance rules in 3.0. Several types
  which did not meet the rules for hash invariants and were already
  unhashable in 3.0 have now been explicitly flagged as unhashable in
  2.6 as well (collections.Mapping, collections.Set, unittest.TestSuite,
  xml.dom.minidom.NamedNodeMap, numbers.Number, UserList.UserList)

- Update __all__ for cookielib, csv, os, urllib2, and weakref to include things
  imported into the module but exposed as part of the module's API.

- Remove an unneeded import of abc.ABCMeta from 'inspect'.

- Remove unneeded imports of 'sys' and 'warnings' from 'io'.

- Remove unneeded imports of 'warnings' from shelve, filecmp, and dummy_thread.

- Issue #3575: Incremental decoder's decode function now takes bytearray
  by using 's*' instead of 't#'.

- Issue #2222: Fixed reference leak when occurred os.rename()
  fails unicode conversion on 2nd parameter. (windows only)

- Issue #2464: urllib2 now supports a malformation in the URL received
  in a redirect.

- Silence the DeprecationWarning raised when importing mimetools in
  BaseHTTPServer, cgi (and rfc822), httplib.

- Issue #2776: fixed small issue when handling an URL with double slash
  after a 302 response in the case of not going through a proxy.

- Issue #2676: in the email package, content-type parsing was hanging on
  pathological input because of quadratic or exponential behaviour of a
  regular expression.

- Issue #3476: binary buffered reading through the new "io" library is now
  thread-safe.

- Silence the DeprecationWarning of rfc822 when it is imported by mimetools
  since mimetools itself is deprecated. Because modules are cached, all
  subsequent imports of rfc822 will not raise a visible DeprecationWarning.

- Issue #3134: shutil referenced undefined WindowsError symbol.

- Issue #1342811: Fix leak in Tkinter.Menu.delete. Commands associated to
  menu entries were not deleted.

- Copied the implementation of reduce() to _functools.reduce() to have a
  version that did not raise a DeprecationWarning under -3.

- Issue #3205: When iterating over a BZ2File fails allocating memory, raise
  a MemoryError rather than silently stop the iteration.

- Issue #3487: sre "bytecode" validator.  Passing invalid "re-bytecode"
  to _sre.compile() will now be rejected.  This should not affect anybody
  since the re.compile() function never generates invalid re-bytecode.

- Issue #3436: Make csv.DictReader's fieldnames attribute a property so that
  upon first access it can be automatically initialized from the csv file if
  it wasn't initialized during instantiation.

- Issue #2338: Create imp.reload() to help with transitioning to Python 3.0 as
  the reload() built-in has been removed.

- Changed code in the following modules/packages to remove warnings raised
  while running under the ``-3`` flag: aifc, asynchat, asyncore, bdb, bsddb,
  ConfigParser, cookielib, csv, difflib, distutils, DocXMLRPCServer, email,
  filecmp, fileinput, inspect, logging, modulefinder, pdb, pickle, profile,
  pstats, pydoc, re, rlcompleter, SimpleXMLRPCServer, shelve, socket,
  subprocess, sqlite3, tarfile, Tkinter, test.test_support, textwrap,
  threading, tokenize, traceback, urlparse, wsgiref, xml, xmlrpclib.

- Issue #3039: Fix tarfile.TarFileCompat.writestr() which always
  raised an AttributeError.

- Issue #2523: Fix quadratic behaviour when read()ing a binary file without
  asking for a specific length. This problem only affected files opened
  using the new "io" module, not the built-in open() function.

- Issue #3449: Update decimal module to use most recent specification
  (v. 1.68) and tests (v. 2.58) from IBM.

- Issue #3437: Bug fix in robotparser parsing of Allow: lines.

- Issue #1592:  Improve error reporting when operations are attempted
  on a closed shelf.

- Deprecate the "ast" parser function aliases.

- Issue #3120: On 64-bit Windows the subprocess module was truncating handles.

- Issue #3303: Fix a crash in locale.strcoll() when calling it with
  invalid arguments.

- Issue #3302: Fix several crashes when calling locale's gettext functions
  with None arguments.

- Issue #3389: Allow resolving dotted names for handlers in logging
  configuration files.

- Deprecate the sunaudio module for removal in Python 3.0.

- Issue #3394: zipfile.writestr sets external attributes when passed a
  file name rather than a ZipInfo instance, so files are extracted with
  mode 0600 rather than 000 under Unix.

- Issue #1857: subprocess.Popen.poll gained an additional _deadstate keyword
  argument in python 2.5, this broke code that subclassed Popen to include its
  own poll method.  Fixed my moving _deadstate to an _internal_poll method.

Build
-----

- Generate the PatternGrammar pickle during "make install".

Documentation
-------------

- Issue #2235: the C API function PyObject_HashNotImplemented and its
  interaction with the tp_hash slot (added in 2.6b2) are now documented

- Issue #643841: The language reference now provides more detailed
  coverage of the lookup process for special methods. The disclaimers
  regarding lack of coverage of new-style classes have also been
  removed, since the coverage is now fairly reasonable.


What's New in Python 2.6 beta 2?
================================

*Release date: 17-Jul-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3156: Fix inconsistent behavior of the bytearray type: all
  its methods now allow for items objects that can be converted to
  an integer using operator.index().

- Issue #3360: Fix incorrect parsing of '020000000000.0', which
  produced a ValueError instead of giving the correct float.

- Issue #3083: Add alternate (#) formatting for bin, oct, hex output
  for str.format().  This adds the prefix 0b, 0o, or 0x, respectively.

- Issue #3008: the float type has a new instance method 'float.hex'
  and a new class method 'float.fromhex' to convert floating-point
  numbers to and from hexadecimal strings, respectively.

- Issue #2235: __hash__ is once again inherited by default. To allow
  collections.Hashable to remain meaningful in the presence of the
  default hash implementation (object.__hash__), it is now possible
  to explicit block inheritance of hash by setting __hash__=None at
  the Python level, or tp_hash=PyObject_HashNotImplemented at the C
  level.

- Issue #3221: Issue a RuntimeWarning instead of raising SystemError if
  the parent module cannot be found while performing an absolute import.
  This means that an incorrectly defined __package__ attribute will
  now only prevent relative imports in that module rather than causing
  all imports from that module to fail.

- Issue #2517: Allow unicode messages in Exceptions again by correctly
  bypassing the instance dictionary when looking up __unicode__ on
  new-style classes.

- Issue #3242: Fix a crash inside the print statement, if sys.stdout is
  set to a custom object whose write() method happens to install
  another file in sys.stdout.

- Issue #3088: Corrected a race condition in classes derived from
  threading.local: the first member set by a thread could be saved in
  another thread's dictionary.

- Issue #3004: Minor change to slice.indices(): the start and stop
  arguments are now treated identically, making the behaviour easier
  to describe and understand.  For example, slice(None, -10,
  1).indices(9) now returns (0, 0, 1) instead of (0, -1, 1), and
  slice(None, 10, -1).indices(10) returns (9, 9, -1) instead of (9,
  10, -1).

- Issue #3219: Calling a function with repeated keyword arguments,
  f(a=2, a=23), would not cause a syntax error.  This was a regression
  from 2.4 caused by the switch to the new compiler.

- Issue #2862: Make int and float freelist management consistent with
  other freelists.  Changes their CompactFreeList apis into
  ClearFreeList apis and calls them via gc.collect().

Library
-------

- Issue #3554: ctypes.string_at and ctypes.wstring_at did call Python
  api functions without holding the GIL, which could lead to a fatal
  error when they failed.

- Issue #799428: Fix Tkinter.Misc._nametowidget to unwrap Tcl command objects.

- Issue #3395: fix reference in test_multiprocessing to old debugInfo method

- Issue #3312: Fix two crashes in sqlite3.

- Issue #1608818: Fix misbehavior in os.listdir() if readdir() fails.

- Issue #3125: Remove copy_reg in multiprocessing and replace it with
  ForkingPickler.register() to resolve conflict with ctypes.

- Issue #3090: Fixed ARCHFLAGS parsing on OS/X

- Issue #3313: Fixed a crash when a failed dlopen() call does not set
  a valid dlerror() message.

- Issue #3258: Fixed a crash when a ctypes POINTER type to an
  incomplete structure was created.

- Issue #3339: dummy_thread.acquire() should not return None.

- Issue #3285: Fractions from_float() and from_decimal() accept Integral arguments.

- Issue #3301: Bisect module behaved badly when lo was negative.

- Issue #839496: SimpleHTTPServer used to open text files in text mode. This is
  both unnecessary (HTTP allows text content to be sent in several forms) and
  wrong because the actual transmitted size could differ from the
  content-length.  The problem had been corrected in the 2.4 branch, but never
  merged into trunk.

- Issue #2663: add filtering capability to shutil.copytree().

- Issue #1622: Correct interpretation of various ZIP header fields.

- Issue #1526: Allow more than 64k files to be added to Zip64 file.

- Issue #1746: Correct handling of zipfile archive comments (previously
  archives with comments over 4k were flagged as invalid). Allow writing
  Zip files with archives by setting the 'comment' attribute of a ZipFile.

- Issue #449227: The rlcompleter module now adds "(" to callable objects
  when completed.

- Issue #3190: Pydoc now hides the automatic module attribute __package__ (the
  handling is now the same as that of other special attributes like __name__).

- Issue #2885 (partial): The urllib.urlopen() function has been deprecated for
  removal in Python 3.0 in favor of urllib2.urlopen().

- Issue #2113: Fix error in subprocess.Popen if the select system call is
  interrupted by a signal.

- Issue #3309: Fix bz2.BZFile iterator to release its internal lock
  properly when raising an exception due to the bz2file being closed.
  Prevents a deadlock.

- Issue #3094: httplib.HTTPSConnection Host: headers no longer include the
  redundant ":443" port number designation when the connection is using the
  default https port (443).

- Issue #874900: after an os.fork() call the threading module state is cleaned
  up in the child process to prevent deadlock and report proper thread counts
  if the new process uses the threading module.

Tests
-----

- test.test_support.catch_warning now keeps track of all warnings it sees
  and is now better documented. Explicit unit tests for this context manager
  have been added to test_warnings.

Build
-----

- Issue #3215: Build sqlite3 as sqlite3.dll, not sqlite3.pyd.


Documentation
-------------

- Document that robotparser has been renamed to urllib.robotparser in
  Python 3.0.

- Document that urlparse has been renamed to urllib.parse in Python 3.0.

- Document that urllib2 is split across multiple modules and renamed in
  Python 3.0.

- Document that urllib is split across multiple modules and renamed in
  Python 3.0.

================================

*Release date: 18-June-2008*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #3211: warnings.warn_explicit() did not guard against its 'registry'
  argument being anything other than a dict or None. Also fixed a bug in error
  handling when 'message' and 'category' were both set to None, triggering a
  bus error.

- Issue #3100: Corrected a crash on deallocation of a subclassed weakref which
  holds the last (strong) reference to its referent.

- Add future_builtins.ascii().

- Several set methods now accept multiple arguments:  update(), union(),
  intersection(), intersection_update(), difference(), and difference_update().

- Issue #2898: Added sys.getsizeof() to retrieve size of objects in bytes.

- New environment variable PYTHONIOENCODING.

- Patch #2488: Add sys.maxsize.

- Issue #2353: file.xreadlines() now emits a Py3k warning.

- Issue #2863: generators now have a ``gen.__name__`` attribute that
  equals ``gen.gi_code.co_name``, like ``func.__name___`` that equals
  ``func.func_code.co_name``.  The repr() of a generator now also
  contains this name.

- Issue #2831: enumerate() now has a ``start`` argument.

- Issue #2801: fix bug in the float.is_integer method where a
  ValueError was sometimes incorrectly raised.

- Issue #2790: sys.flags was not properly exposing its bytes_warning
  attribute.

- Issue #2196: hasattr() now lets exceptions which do not inherit
  Exception (KeyboardInterrupt, and SystemExit) propagate instead of
  ignoring them.

- Added checks for integer overflows, contributed by Google. Some are
  only available if asserts are left in the code, in cases where they
  can't be triggered from Python code.


Extension Modules
-----------------
- Issue #1179: [CVE-2007-4965] Integer overflow in imageop module.

- Issue #3116:  marshal.dumps() had quadratic behavior for strings > 32Mb.

  platform.

- Support for Windows 9x has been removed from the winsound module.

- bsddb module updated to version 4.7.3.
  http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm#bsddb3-4.7.3. This
  code should be compatible with Python 3.0.

- Issue #2858: Fix potential memory corruption when
  bsddb.db.DBEnv.lock_get and other bsddb.db object constructors
  raised an exception.

- Issue #2669: bsddb/__init__.py iteration no longer silently fails when
  the database has changed size during iteration.  It now raises a
  RuntimeError in the same manner as a dictionary.

- Issue #2870: cmathmodule.c compile error.

- Added a threading.Thread.ident property.

Library
-------

- logging.config: Removed out-of-date comment in _install_handlers and
  used issubclass in place of equality comparison of classes.

- Issue #2722: Now the os.getcwd() supports very long path names.

- Issue #2888: Fixed the behaviour of pprint when working with nested
  structures, to match the behaviour of 2.5 and 3.0 (now follows the common
  sense).

- Issue #1817: cgi now correctly handles the querystring on POST requests

- Issue #3136: fileConfig()'s disabling of old loggers is now conditional via
  an optional disable_existing_loggers parameter, but the default value is
  such that the old behaviour is preserved. Thanks to Leandro Lucarella for
  the patch.

- Issue #3126: StreamHandler and FileHandler check before calling "flush" and

  os.uname exists.

- The rfc822 module has been deprecated for removal in 3.0.

  pointer-like object.

- Added the ast module.

- Added the multiprocessing module, PEP 371.

- Factored out the indentation cleaning from inspect.getdoc() into
  inspect.cleandoc() to ease standalone use.

  to errno.

- Issue #2404: ctypes objects support the new pep3118 buffer interface.

- Patch #2125: Add GetInteger and GetString methods for
  msilib.Record objects.

- Issue #2782: The datetime module's strftime methods now accept
  unicode format strings just as time.strftime always has.

- The sgmllib and htmllib modules have been deprecated for removal
  in Python 3.0.

- Issue #3011: locale module alias table was updated to the latest
  version from the X.org locale.alias file.

  deleting old log files (filename only instead of full path).

- Issue #1775025: You can now specify zipfile members to open(),
  read() or extract() via a ZipInfo instance.  This allows handling
  duplicate filenames in zipfiles.

- Issue #961805: Fix Text.edit_modified() in Tkinter.

- The PyBytes functions have been renamed to PyByteArray.

- The PyString functions have been renamed to PyBytes. A batch of
  defines were added so that the linker still sees the original
  PyString names.


What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 08-May-2008*

Core and builtins
-----------------

- Issue #2719: backported the ``next()`` builtin from Python 3.

- Issue #2681: The octal literal ``0o8`` was incorrecly acctepted. Now
  it properly raises a SyntaxError.

- Issue #2617: Reserved -J and -X arguments for Jython, IronPython and
  other implementations of Python.

- Implemented PEP 370: Per user site-packages directory.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #2670: Fix a failure in urllib2.build_opener(), when passed
  two handlers that derive the same default base class.

- Added kill, terminate and send_signal(sig) to subprocess.Popen.

- Added phase(z) -> phi, polar(z) -> r, phi and rect(r, phi) -> z to
  the cmath module.

- Four new methods were added to the math and cmath modules: acosh,
  asinh, atanh and log1p.

- zlib.decompressobj().flush(value) no longer crashes the interpreter
  when passed a value less than or equal to zero.

- Issue #1631171: Re-implement the 'warnings' module in C (the
  original Python code has been kept as backup). This will allow for
  using the 'warning's machinery in such places as the parser where
  use of pure Python code is not possible.  Both the ``showarning()``
  and ``formatwarning()`` gain an optional 'line' argument which is
  not called by default for backwards-compatibility reasons. Setting
  ``warnings.showwarning()`` to an implementation that lacks support
  for the ``line`` argument will raise a DeprecationWarning.

Library
-------

- The audiodev module has been deprecated for removal in Python 3.0.

- Issue #2750: Add the 'json' package. Based on simplejson 1.9 and
  contributed by Bob Ippolito.

- Issue #1734346: Support Unicode file names for zipfiles.

- Issue #2581: distutils: Vista UAC/elevation support for
  bdist_wininst.

- Issue #2635: Fix bug in 'fix_sentence_endings' textwrap.fill option,
  where an extra space was added after a word containing (but not
  ending in) '.', '!' or '?'.

- Add from_buffer() and from_buffer_copy() class methods to ctypes
  data types.

- Issue #2682: ctypes callback functions no longer contain a cyclic
  reference to themselves.

- The getpass module has been improved on Unix.  It now uses /dev/tty
  by default and uses stderr instead of stdout.  A GetPassWarning is
  issued when input echo cannot be controlled.

- Issue #2014: Allow XML-RPC datetime objects to have dates before
  1900-01-01.

- Issue #2439: Added new function pkgutil.get_data(), which is a
  convenience wrapper for the PEP 302 get_data() API.

- Issue #2616: The ctypes.pointer() and ctypes.POINTER() functions are
  now implemented in C for better performance.

- Issue #2408: The ``_types`` module, which was used as in
  implementation detail of the public ``types`` module, has been
  removed and replaced by pure python code.

- Issue #2513: distutils on Windows is now capable of cross-compiling
  extension modules between 32 and 64 bit platforms.  See the distutls
  build documentation for more information.

- Issue #815646: Individual file objects may now be used from multiple
  threads at once without fear of crashing the Python interpreter.  If
  file.close() is called while an object is in use by another thread
  an IOError exception will be raised and the file will not be closed.

- The bundled libffi copy is now in sync with the recently released
  libffi3.0.5 version, apart from some small changes to
  Modules/_ctypes/libffi/configure.ac.

- Issue #2385: distutils.core.run_script() makes __file__ available,
  so the controlled environment will more closely mirror the typical
  script environment.  This supports setup.py scripts that refer to
  data files.

Tests
-----

- Issue #2550: The approach used by client/server code for obtaining
  ports to listen on in network-oriented tests has been refined in an
  effort to facilitate running multiple instances of the entire
  regression test suite in parallel without issue.
  test_support.bind_port() has been fixed such that it will always
  return a unique port -- which wasn't always the case with the
  previous implementation, especially if socket options had been set
  that affected address reuse (i.e. SO_REUSEADDR, SO_REUSEPORT).  The
  new implementation of bind_port() will actually raise an exception
  if it is passed an AF_INET/SOCK_STREAM socket with either the
  SO_REUSEADDR or SO_REUSEPORT socket option set.  Furthermore, if
  available, bind_port() will set the SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE option on
  the socket it's been passed.  This currently only applies to
  Windows.  This option prevents any other sockets from binding to the
  host/port we've bound to, thus removing the possibility of the
  'non-deterministic' behaviour, as Microsoft puts it, that occurs
  when a second SOCK_STREAM socket binds and accepts to a host/port
  that's already been bound by another socket.  The optional preferred
  port parameter to bind_port() has been removed.  Under no
  circumstances should tests be hard coding ports!

  test_support.find_unused_port() has also been introduced, which will
  pass a temporary socket object to bind_port() in order to obtain an
  unused port.  The temporary socket object is then closed and
  deleted, and the port is returned.  This method should only be used
  for obtaining an unused port in order to pass to an external program
  (i.e. the -accept [port] argument to openssl's s_server mode) or as
  a parameter to a server-oriented class that doesn't give you direct
  access to the underlying socket used.

  Finally, test_support.HOST has been introduced, which should be used
  for the host argument of any relevant socket calls (i.e. bind and
  connect).

  The following tests were updated to following the new conventions:
    test_socket, test_smtplib, test_asyncore, test_ssl, test_httplib,
    test_poplib, test_ftplib, test_telnetlib, test_socketserver,
    test_asynchat and test_socket_ssl.

  It is now possible for multiple instances of the regression test
  suite to run in parallel without issue.

Build
-----

- Issue #1496032: On alpha, use -mieee when gcc is the compiler.

- Issue #2544: On HP-UX systems, use 'gcc -shared' for linking when
  gcc is used as compiler.

- Issue #2573: On MacOS X it is now possible to install the framework
  with a different name using --with-framework-name=NAME.

C API
-----

- Added implementation of copysign, acosh, asinh, atanh and log1p to
  the new files Include/pymath.h and Python/pymath.h for platforms
  which provide the functions through their libm. The files also
  contains several helpers and constants for math.

- Added a new convenience macro, PyErr_WarnPy3k, for issuing Py3k warnings.


What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 02-Apr-2008*

  tracing function set by sys.settrace is still active and happens to
  call threading.currentThread().

- Patch #1442: properly report exceptions when the PYTHONSTARTUP file
  cannot be executed.

- The compilation of a class nested in another class used to leak one
  reference on the outer class name.

- Patch #1810: compile() can now compile _ast trees as returned by

- Patch #2477: Added from __future__ import unicode_literals.

- Added backport of bytearray type.

- Issue #2355: add Py3k warning for buffer().

- Issue #1477: With narrow Unicode builds, the unicode escape sequence
  \Uxxxxxxxx did not accept values outside the Basic Multilingual
  Plane.  This affected raw unicode literals and the
  'raw-unicode-escape' codec.  Now UTF-16 surrogates are generated in
  this case, like normal unicode literals and the 'unicode-escape'
  codec.

- Issue #2348: add Py3k warning for file.softspace.

- Issue #2346/#2347: add Py3k warnings for __methods__ and
  __members__.

- Issue #2358: Add a Py3k warning on sys.exc_clear() usage.

- Issue #2400: Allow relative imports to "import *".

- Issue #1745: Backport print function with ``from __future__ import
  print_function``.

  doesn't derive from BaseException.

- Issue #2321: use pymalloc for unicode object string data to reduce
  memory usage in some circumstances.

- PEP 3127: octal literals now start with "0o". Old-style octal
  literals are still valid. There are binary literals with a prefix of
  "0b".  This also affects int(x, 0).

- Issue #2359: Adding deprecation warnings for array.{read,write}.

- Issue #1779871: GNU gcc can now build Python on OS X because the
  flags -Wno-long-double, -no-cpp-precomp, and -mno-fused-madd are no
  longer passed.

- Add a warning when asserting a non-empty tuple which is always true.

- Issue #2179: speed up with statement execution by storing the exit
  method on the stack instead of in a temporary variable (patch by
  Jeffrey Yaskin)

- Issue #2238: Some syntax errors in *args and **kwargs expressions
  could give bogus error messages.

- Issue #2143: Fix embedded readline() hang on SSL socket EOF.

Extension Modules
-----------------

Library
-------

- Issue #2315: logging.handlers: TimedRotatingFileHandler now accounts
  for daylight savings time in calculating the next rollover.

- Issue #2316: logging.handlers: TimedRotatingFileHandler now
  calculates rollovers correctly even when nothing is logged for a
  while.

- Issue #2317: logging.handlers: TimedRotatingFileHandler now uses
  improved logic for removing old files.

- Issue #2495: tokenize.untokenize now inserts a space between two
  consecutive string literals; previously, ["" ""] was rendered as
  [""""], which is incorrect python code.

- Issue #2248: return the result of the QUIT command. from
  SMTP.quit().

- Backport of Python 3.0's io module.

- Issue #2482: Make sure that the coefficient of a Decimal is always
  stored as a str instance, not as a unicode instance.  This ensures
  that str(Decimal) is always an instance of str.

- Issue #2478: fix failure of decimal.Decimal(0).sqrt()

- Issue #2432: give DictReader the dialect and line_num attributes
  advertised in the docs.

- Issue #2460: Make Ellipsis object copyable.

- Issue #1681432: Add triangular distribution to the random module

- Issue #2136: urllib2's auth handler now allows single-quoted realms
  in the WWW-Authenticate header.

- Issue #2434: Enhanced platform.win32_ver() to also work on Python
  installation which do not have the win32all package installed.

- Added support to platform.uname() to also report the machine and
  processor information on Windows XP and later. As a result,
  platform.machine() and platform.processor() will report this
  information as well.

- The library implementing the 2to3 conversion, lib2to3, was added to
  the standard distribution.

- Issue #1747858: Fix chown to work with large uid's and gid's on
  64-bit platforms.

- Issue #1202: zlib.crc32 and zlib.adler32 no longer return different
  values on 32-bit vs. 64-bit python interpreters.  Both were correct,
  but they now both return a signed integer object for consistency.

- Issue #1158: add %f format (fractions of a second represented as
  microseconds) to datetime objects.  Understood by both strptime and
  strftime.

- Issue #705836: struct.pack(">f", x) now raises OverflowError on all
  platforms when x is too large to fit into an IEEE 754 float;
  previously it only raised OverflowError on non IEEE 754 platforms.

- Issues #2166, #1741 and #1531505: now distutils deals with HOME
  correctly under win32

- Patch #1858: distutils: added multiple server support in .pypirc

- Issue #1106316: pdb.post_mortem()'s parameter, "traceback", is now
  optional: it defaults to the traceback of the exception that is
  currently being handled (is mandatory to be in the middle of an
  exception, otherwise it raises ValueError).

- Issue #1193577: A .shutdown() method has been added to SocketServers
  which terminates the .serve_forever() loop.

- Issue #2220: handle rlcompleter attribute match failure more
  gracefully.

- Issue #2225: py_compile, when executed as a script, now returns a
  non- zero status code if not all files could be compiled
  successfully.

- Bug #1725737: In distutils' sdist, exclude RCS, CVS etc. also in the
  root directory, and also exclude .hg, .git, .bzr, and _darcs.

- Issue #1872: The struct module typecode for _Bool has been changed
  from 't' to '?'.

- The bundled libffi copy is now in sync with the recently released
  libffi3.0.4 version, apart from some small changes to
  Modules/_ctypes/libffi/configure.ac.  On OS X, preconfigured libffi
  files are used.  On all linux systems the --with-system-ffi
  configure option defaults to "yes".

- Issue #1577: shutil.move() now calls os.rename() if the destination
  is a directory instead of copying-then-remove-source.

Tests
-----

  PyParser_ParseStringFlagsFilenameEx().


What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: 29-Feb-2008*

Core and builtins
-----------------

- Issue #2051: pyc and pyo files are no longer created with permission
  644. The mode is now inherited from the py file.

- Issue #2067: file.__exit__() now calls subclasses' close() method.

- Patch #1759: Backport of PEP 3129 class decorators.

- Issue #1881: An internal parser limit has been increased. Also see
  issue #215555 for a discussion.

- Added the future_builtins module, which contains hex() and oct().
  These are the PEP 3127 version of these functions, designed to be
  compatible with the hex() and oct() builtins from Python 3.0.  They
  differ slightly in their output formats from the existing, unchanged
  Python 2.6 builtins.  The expected usage of the future_builtins
  module is:
    from future_builtins import hex, oct

- Issue #1600: Modifed PyOS_ascii_formatd to use at most 2 digit
  exponents for exponents with absolute value < 100.  Follows C99
  standard.  This is a change on Windows, which would use 3 digits.
  Also, added 'n' to the formats that PyOS_ascii_formatd understands,
  so that any alterations it does to the resulting string will be
  available in stringlib/formatter.h (for float.__format__).

- Implemented PEP 3101, Advanced String Formatting.  This adds a new
  builtin format(); a format() method for str and unicode; a
  __format__() method to object, str, unicode, int, long, float, and
  datetime; the class string.Formatter; and the C API
  PyObject_Format().

- Fixed several potential crashes, all caused by specially crafted
  __del__ methods exploiting objects in temporarily inconsistent
  state.

- Issue #2115: Important speedup in setting __slot__ attributes.  Also
  prevent a possible crash: an Abstract Base Class would try to access
  a slot on a registered virtual subclass.

- Fixed repr() and str() of complex numbers with infinity or nan as
  real or imaginary part.

- Clear all free lists during a gc.collect() of the highest generation
  in order to allow pymalloc to free more arenas. Python may give back
  memory to the OS earlier.

- Issue #2045: Fix an infinite recursion triggered when printing a
  subclass of collections.defaultdict, if its default_factory is set
  to a bound method.

- Fixed a minor memory leak in dictobject.c. The content of the free
  list was not freed on interpreter shutdown.

- Limit free list of method and built-in function objects to 256
  entries each.

- Patch #1953: Added ``sys._compact_freelists()`` and the C API
  functions ``PyInt_CompactFreeList`` and ``PyFloat_CompactFreeList``
  to compact the internal free lists of pre-allocted ints and floats.

- Issue #1983: Fixed return type of fork(), fork1() and forkpty()
  calls.  Python expected the return type int but the fork familie
  returns pi_t.

- Issue #1678380: Fix a bug that identifies 0j and -0j when they
  appear in the same code unit.

- Issue #2025: Add tuple.count() and tuple.index() methods to comply
  with the collections.Sequence API.

- Patch #1970 by Antoine Pitrou: Speedup unicode whitespace and
  linebreak detection

- Added ``PyType_ClearCache()`` and ``sys._clear_type_cache`` to clear
  the internal lookup cache for ref leak tests.

- Patch #1473257: generator objects gain a gi_code attribute. This is
  the same object as the func_code attribute of the function that
  produced the generator.

- Issue #1920: "while 0" statements were completely removed by the
  compiler, even in the presence of an "else" clause, which is
  supposed to be run when the condition is false. Now the compiler
  correctly emits bytecode for the "else" suite.

- A few crashers fixed: weakref_in_del.py (issue #1377858);
  loosing_dict_ref.py (issue #1303614, test67.py);
  borrowed_ref_[34].py (not in tracker).

- Issue #1069410: The "can't load dll" message box on Windows is
  suppressed while an extension is loaded by calling SetErrorMode in
  dynload_win.c. The error is still reported properly.

- Issue #1915: Python compiles with --enable-unicode=no again. However
  several extension methods and modules do not work without unicode
  support.

- Issue #1882: when compiling code from a string, encoding cookies in the
  second line of code were not always recognized correctly.

- Issue #1679: "0x" was taken as a valid integer literal.

- Issue #1865: ``bytes`` as an alias for ``str`` and b"" as an alias "" were
  added.

- sys.float_info / PyFloat_GetInfo: The floating point information
  object was converted from a dict to a specialized structseq object.

- Patch #1816: Added sys.flags structseq. It exposes the status of
  most command line arguments and PYTHON* environment variables.

- Objects/structseq.c: Implemented new structseq representation. The
  patch makes structseqs (e.g. the return value of os.stat) more
  readable.

- Patch #1700288: added a type attribute cache that caches method
  accesses, resulting in speedups in heavily object-oriented code.

- Bug #1776: __import__() no longer accepts filenames on any platform.
  The first parameter to __import__() must be a valid module name.

- Patch #1668: renamed THREADDEBUG envvar to PYTHONTHREADDEBUG.

- Patch #602345: Add -B command line option, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE
  envvar and sys.dont_write_bytecode attribute. All these can be set
  to forbid Python to attempt to write compiled bytecode files.

- Improve some exception messages when Windows fails to load an
  extension module. Now we get for example '%1 is not a valid Win32
  application' instead of 'error code 193'.

- Bug #1481296: Fixed long(float('nan')) != 0L.

- Issue #1640: Added math.isinf(x), math.isnan(x) and math.copysign(x,
  y) functions.

- Issue #1635: Platform independent creation and representation of NaN
  and INF. float("nan"), float("inf") and float("-inf") now work on
  every platform with IEEE 754 semantics.

- Compiler now generates simpler and faster code for dictionary
  literals.  The oparg for BUILD_MAP now indicates an estimated
  dictionary size.  There is a new opcode, STORE_MAP, for adding
  entries to the dictionary.

- Issue #1638: %zd configure test fails on Linux.

- Issue #1620: New property decorator syntax was modifying the
  decorator in place instead of creating a new decorator object.

- Issue #1538: Avoid copying string in split/rsplit if the split char
  is not found.

- Issue #1553: An erroneous __length_hint__ can make list() raise a
  SystemError.

- PEP 366: Allow explicit relative imports when executing modules
  inside packages with the -m switch via a new module level
  __package__ attribute.

- Issue #1402: Fix a crash on exit, when another thread is still
  running, and if the deallocation of its frames somehow calls the
  PyGILState_Ensure() / PyGILState_Release() functions.

- Expose the Py_Py3kWarningFlag as sys.py3kwarning.

- Issue #1445: Fix a SystemError when accessing the ``cell_contents``
  attribute of an empty cell object.

- Issue #1460: The utf-7 incremental decoder did not accept truncated
  input.  It now correctly saves its state between chunks of data.

- Patch #1739468: Directories and zipfiles containing a __main__.py
  file can now be directly executed by passing their name to the
  interpreter. The directory/zipfile is automatically inserted as the
  first entry in sys.path.

- Issue #1265: Fix a problem with sys.settrace, if the tracing
  function uses a generator expression when at the same time the
  executed code is closing a paused generator.

- sets and frozensets now have an isdisjoint() method.

- optimize the performance of builtin.sum().

- Fix warnings found by the new version of the Coverity checker.

- The enumerate() built-in function is no longer bounded to sequences
  smaller than LONG_MAX.  Formerly, it raised an OverflowError.  Now,
  automatically shifts from ints to longs.

- Issue #1686386: Tuple's tp_repr did not take into account the
  possibility of having a self-referential tuple, which is possible
  from C code.  Nor did object's tp_str consider that a type's tp_str
  could do something that could lead to an inifinite recursion.
  Py_ReprEnter() and Py_EnterRecursiveCall(), respectively, fixed the
  issues.

- Issue #1164: It was possible to trigger deadlock when using the
  'print' statement to write to a file since the GIL was not released
  as needed.  Now PyObject_Print() does the right thing along with
  various tp_print implementations of the built-in types and those in
  the collections module.

- Issue #1147: Exceptions were directly allowing string exceptions in
  their throw() method even though string exceptions no longer
  allowed.

- Issue #1096: Prevent a segfault from getting the repr of a very
  deeply nested list by using the recursion counter.

- Issue #1202533: Fix infinite recursion calls triggered by calls to
  PyObject_Call() never calling back out to Python code to trigger
  recursion depth updates/checks.  Required the creation of a static
  RuntimeError instance in case normalizing an exception put the
  recursion check value past its limit.  Fixes crashers
  infinite_rec_(1|2|4|5).py.

- Patch #1031213: Decode source line in SyntaxErrors back to its
  original source encoding.

- Patch #1673759: add a missing overflow check when formatting floats
  with %G.

- Prevent expandtabs() on string and unicode objects from causing a
  segfault when a large width is passed on 32-bit platforms.

- Issue #1733488: Fix compilation of bufferobject.c on AIX.

- Issue #1722485: remove docstrings again when running with -OO.

- Add new attribute names for function objects.  All the func_* become
  __*__ attributes.  (Some already existed, e.g., __doc__ and
  __name__.)

- Add -3 option to the interpreter to warn about features that are
  deprecated and will be changed/removed in Python 3.0.

- Patch #1686487: you can now pass any mapping after '**' in function
  calls.

- except clauses may now be spelled either "except E, target:" or
  "except E as target:". This is to provide forwards compatibility
  with Python 3.0.

- Deprecate BaseException.message as per PEP 352.

- Issue #1303614: don't expose object's __dict__ when the dict is
  inherited from a built-in base.

- When __slots__ are set to a unicode string, make it work the same as
  setting a plain string, ie don't expand to single letter identifiers.

- Request #1191699:  Slices can now be pickled.

- Request #1193128:  str.translate() now allows a None argument for
  translations that only remove characters without re-mapping the
  remaining characters.

- Patch #1682205: a TypeError while unpacking an iterable is no longer
  masked by a generic one with the message "unpack non-sequence".

- Remove unused file Python/fmod.c.

- Bug #1683368: The object.__init__() and object.__new__() methods are
  now stricter in rejecting excess arguments.  The only time when
  either allows excess arguments is when it is not overridden and the
  other one is.  For backwards compatibility, when both are
  overridden, it is a deprecation warning (for now; maybe a Py3k
  warning later).  Also, type.__init__() insists on the same signature
  as supported by type.__new__().

- Patch #1675423: PyComplex_AsCComplex() now tries to convert an
  object to complex using its __complex__() method before falling back
  to the __float__() method. Therefore, the functions in the cmath
  module now can operate on objects that define a __complex__()
  method.

- Patch #1623563: allow __class__ assignment for classes with
  __slots__.  The old and the new class are still required to have the
  same slot names.

  in complex if statements.

- Patch #1462488: Python no longer segfaults when
  ``object.__reduce_ex__()`` is called with an object that is faking
  its type.

- Patch #1680015: Don't modify __slots__ tuple if it contains an
  unicode name.

- Patch #1444529: the builtin compile() now accepts keyword arguments.

- Bug #1678647: write a newline after printing an exception in any
  case, even when converting the value to a string failed.

- The dir() function has been extended to call the __dir__() method on
  its argument, if it exists. If not, it will work like before. This
  allows customizing the output of dir() in the presence of a
  __getattr__().

- Patch #922167: Python no longer segfaults when faced with infinitely
  self-recursive reload() calls (as reported by bug #742342).

- Patch #1675981: remove unreachable code from ``type.__new__()``
  method.

- Patch #1491866: change the complex() constructor to allow
  parthensized forms. This means complex(repr(x)) now works instead of
  raising a ValueError.

- Patch #703779: unset __file__ in __main__ after running a file. This
  makes the filenames the warning module prints much more sensible
  when a PYTHONSTARTUP file is used.

- Variant of patch #697613: don't exit the interpreter on a SystemExit
  exception if the -i command line option or PYTHONINSPECT environment
  variable is given, but break into the interactive interpreter just
  like on other exceptions or normal program exit.

- Patch #1638879: don't accept strings with embedded NUL bytes in
  long().

- Bug #1674503: close the file opened by execfile() in an error
  condition.

- Patch #1674228: when assigning a slice (old-style), check for the
  sq_ass_slice instead of the sq_slice slot.

- When printing an unraisable error, don't print exceptions. before
  the name.  This duplicates the behavior whening normally printing
  exceptions.

- Bug #1653736: Properly discard third argument to
  slot_nb_inplace_power.

- PEP 352: Raising a string exception now triggers a TypeError.
  Attempting to catch a string exception raises DeprecationWarning.

- Bug #1377858: Fix the segfaulting of the interpreter when an object
  created a weakref on itself during a __del__ call for new-style
  classes (classic classes still have the bug).

- Bug #1579370: Make PyTraceBack_Here use the current thread, not the
  frame's thread state.

- patch #1630975: Fix crash when replacing sys.stdout in
  sitecustomize.py.

- Prevent seg fault on shutdown which could occur if an object raised
  a warning.

- Bug #1566280: Explicitly invoke threading._shutdown from Py_Main, to
  avoid relying on atexit.

- Bug #1590891: random.randrange don't return correct value for big
  number.

- Patch #1586791: Better exception messages for some operations on
  strings, tuples and lists.

- Bug #1067760: Deprecate passing floats to file.seek.

- Bug #1591996: Correctly forward exception in instance_contains().

- Bug #1588287: fix invalid assertion for `1,2` in debug builds.

- Bug #1576657: when setting a KeyError for a tuple key, make sure
  that the tuple isn't used as the "exception arguments tuple".

- Bug #1576174: WindowsError now displays the windows error code
  again, no longer the posix error code.

  if the assigned value for structmember fields gets truncated.

- Update the peephole optimizer to remove more dead code (jumps after
  returns) and inline unconditional jumps to returns.

- Bug #1545497: when given an explicit base, int() did ignore NULs
  embedded in the string to convert.

- Bug #1569998: break inside a try statement (outside a loop) is now
  recognized and rejected.

- list.pop(x) accepts any object x following the __index__ protocol.

- A number of places, including integer negation and absolute value,
  were fixed to not rely on undefined behaviour of the C compiler
  anymore.

- Bug #1566800: make sure that EnvironmentError can be called with any
  number of arguments, as was the case in Python 2.4.

- Patch #1567691: super() and new.instancemethod() now don't accept
  keyword arguments any more (previously they accepted them, but
  didn't use them).

- Fix a bug in the parser's future statement handling that led to
  "with" not being recognized as a keyword after, e.g., this
  statement: from __future__ import division, with_statement

- Bug #1557232: fix seg fault with def f((((x)))) and def f(((x),)).

- Fix %zd string formatting on Mac OS X so it prints negative numbers.

- Allow exception instances to be directly sliced again.

- Bug #1551432: Exceptions do not define an explicit __unicode__
  method.  This allows calling unicode() on exceptions classes
  directly to succeed.

- Bug #1542051: Exceptions now correctly call PyObject_GC_UnTrack.
  Also make sure that every exception class has __module__ set to
  'exceptions'.

- Bug #1550983: emit better error messages for erroneous relative
  imports (if not in package and if beyond toplevel package).

- Overflow checking code in integer division ran afoul of new gcc
  optimizations.  Changed to be more standard-conforming.

- Patch #1542451: disallow continue anywhere under a finally.

- Patch #1546288: fix seg fault in dict_equal due to ref counting bug.

- The return tuple from str.rpartition(sep) is (tail, sep, head) where
  head is the original string if sep was not found.

- Bug #1520864: unpacking singleton tuples in list comprehensions and
  generator expressions (x for x, in ... ) works again.  Fixing this
  problem required changing the .pyc magic number.  This means that
  .pyc files generated before 2.5c2 will be regenerated.

- ``with`` and ``as`` are now keywords.

- Bug #1664966: Fix crash in exec if Unicode filename can't be
  decoded.

- Issue #1537: Changed GeneratorExit's base class from Exception to
  BaseException.

- Issue #1703448: A joined thread could show up in the
  threading.enumerate() list after the join() for a brief period until
  it actually exited.

  (as opposed to the command line) will now write file names ending in
  ".cpp" too.

  closes patch #723312.

- Patch #1676823: Added create_connection() to socket.py, which may be
  called with a timeout, and use it from httplib (whose HTTPConnection

  to strings for the code to time and the setup code. Also added two
  convenience functions for instantiating a Timer and calling its
  methods.

  equal to calling getsockname() on the server's socket. Fixed by
  patch #1545011.

- Patch #742598: Add .timeout attribute to SocketServer that calls
  .handle_timeout() when no requests are received.

- Bug #1651235: When a tuple was passed to a ctypes function call,
  Python would crash instead of raising an error.

- unittest now verifies more of its assumptions. In particular,
  TestCase and TestSuite subclasses (not instances) are no longer
  accepted in TestSuite.addTest(). This should cause no
  incompatibility since it never made sense with ordinary subclasses
  -- the failure just occurred later, with a more cumbersome
  exception.

- The version number of the ctypes package changed to "1.1.0".

- Bug #1627575: logging: Added _open() method to FileHandler which can
  be used to reopen files. The FileHandler instance now saves the
  encoding (which can be None) in an attribute called "encoding".

  obtained from the TLS negotiation itself.  Patch contributed by Bill
  Fenner.

- Issue #1339: The smtplib.SMTP class has been refactored a bit such
  that the SMTP.starttls() caller no longer needs to call ehlo()

  does not claim to support starttls.  Adds the
  SMTP.ehlo_or_helo_if_needed() method.  Patch contributed by Bill
  Fenner.

  support the context manager protocol.  The _winreg module also
  gained a new function ``ExpandEnvironmentStrings`` to expand

  time so that opening a database previously created with the DB_DUP
  or DB_DUPSORT flag set will keep the proper behavior on subsequent
  opens.  Specifically: dictionary assignment to a DB object will
  replace all values for a given key when the database allows
  duplicate values.  DB users should use DB.put(k, v) when they want
  to store duplicates; not DB[k] = v.

- Add the bsddb.db.DBEnv.lock_id_free method.

- Bug #1686475: Support stat'ing open files on Windows again.

- Patch #1185447: binascii.b2a_qp() now correctly quotes binary

  module being tested.  Was causing an error by __import__ doing a
  reload on the second run and thus suppressing bytecode recreation.

- Capture socket connection resets and timeouts in test_socket_ssl and
  test_urllib2net and raise test.test_support.ResourceDenied.

- Patch #1559413: Fix test_cmd_line if sys.executable contains a

  shutil.copy to preserve user/group and permissions. Added also a
  --nobackup option to not create the backup if the user is concerned
  regarding this.  Check issue #1050828 for more details.

- Tools/scripts/win_add2path.py was added. The simple script modifes
  the PATH environment var of the HKCU tree and adds the python bin
  and script directory.

- Tools/18n/pygettext.py was added to the list of scripts installed by
  Tools/scripts/setup.py (tracker item 642309).

- Added IronPython and Jython support to pybench (part of which was
  patch #1563844).

- Made some minor changes to pybench output to allow the user to see
  which Python version is running pybench.

  Repair so that it's back to how it was in 2.4.3.

- Patch #1576954: Update VC6 build directory; remove redundant files
  in VC7.

- Bug #1568842: Fix test for uintptr_t.

- Patch #1540470: for OpenBSD 4.0.

- Fix build failure on kfreebsd and on the hurd.

- Fix the build of the library reference in info format.

- Allow Emacs 22 for building the documentation in info format.

- Makefile.pre.in(buildbottest): Run an optional script
  pybuildbot.identify to include some information about the build
  environment.


C API
-----

- Unified naming convention for free lists and their limits. All free
  lists in Object/ are named ``free_list``, the counter ``numfree``
  and the upper limit is a macro ``PyName_MAXFREELIST`` inside an
  #ifndef block.

- ``PySet_Add()`` can now modify a newly created frozenset.  Similarly
  to ``PyTuple_SetItem``, it can be used to populate a brand new
  frozenset; but it does not steal a reference to the added item.

- Added ``PySet_Check()`` and ``PyFrozenSet_Check()`` to the set API.

- Backport of PyUnicode_FromString(), _FromStringAndSize(), _Format
  and _FormatV from Python 3.0. Made PyLong_AsSsize_t and
  PyLong_FromSsize_t public functions.

- Patch #1720595: add T_BOOL to the range of structmember types.

- Issue #1534: Added ``PyFloat_GetMax()``, ``PyFloat_GetMin()`` and
  ``PyFloat_GetInfo()`` to the float API.

- Issue #1521: On 64bit platforms, using PyArgs_ParseTuple with the t#
  of w# format code incorrectly truncated the length to an int, even
  when PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN is set.  The str.decode method used to return
  incorrect results with huge strings.

- Issue #1629: Renamed Py_Size, Py_Type and Py_Refcnt to Py_SIZE,
  Py_TYPE and Py_REFCNT.

- PEP 3123: Provide forward compatibility with Python 3.0, while
  keeping backwards compatibility. Add Py_Refcnt, Py_Type, Py_Size,
  and PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT.

- Py_ssize_t fields work in structmember when HAVE_LONG_LONG is not
  defined.

- Patch #1733960: Allow T_LONGLONG to accept ints.

- T_PYSSIZET can now be used in PyMemberDef lists for Py_ssize_t members.

- Added a new API function ``PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock``.

- Bug #1637022: Prefix AST symbols with _Py_.

- Fix some leftovers from the conversion from int to Py_ssize_t
  (relevant to strings and sequences of more than 2**31 items).

- Make _PyGILState_NoteThreadState() static, it was not used anywhere
  outside of pystate.c and should not be necessary.

- ``PyImport_Import`` and ``PyImport_ImportModule`` now always do
  absolute imports. In earlier versions they might have used relative
  imports under some conditions.

- Added case insensitive comparison methods ``PyOS_stricmp(char*,
  char*)`` and ``PyOS_strnicmp(char*, char*, Py_ssize_t)``.

- Bug #1542693: remove semi-colon at end of PyImport_ImportModuleEx
  macro so it can be used as an expression.


Windows
-------

- Patch #1706: Drop support for Win9x, WinME and NT4. Python now
  requires Windows 2000 or greater. The _WINVER and NTDDI_VERSION
  macros are set to Win2k for x86/32bit builds and WinXP for AMD64
  builds.

- Conditionalize definition of _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE and
  _CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE.

- Bug #1216: Restore support for Visual Studio 2002.


Mac
---

- cfmfile now raises a DeprecationWarning.

- buildtools now raises a DeprecationWarning.

- Removed the macfs module.  It had been deprecated since Python 2.5.
  This lead to the deprecation of macostools.touched() as it relied
  solely on macfs and was a no-op under OS X.
