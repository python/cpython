  finding the bug and providing a patch.

- Issue #12973: Fix overflow checks that relied on undefined behaviour in

  Patch by Hynek Schlawack.

- Issue #13989: Document that GzipFile does not support text mode, and give a
  more helpful error message when opened with an invalid mode string.

- Issue #13590: On OS X 10.7 and 10.6 with Xcode 4.2, building
  Distutils-based packages with C extension modules may fail because
  Apple has removed gcc-4.2, the version used to build python.org
  64-bit/32-bit Pythons.  If the user does not explicitly override
  the default C compiler by setting the CC environment variable,
  Distutils will now attempt to compile extension modules with clang
  if gcc-4.2 is required but not found. Also as a convenience, if
  the user does explicitly set CC, substitute its value as the default
  compiler in the Distutils LDSHARED configuration variable for OS X.
  (Note, the python.org 32-bit-only Pythons use gcc-4.0 and the 10.4u
  SDK, neither of which are available in Xcode 4.  This change does not
  attempt to override settings to support their use with Xcode 4.)

  IV attack countermeasure.

- Issue #13772: In os.symlink() under Windows, do not try to guess the link

  using the unittest module.  This is useful with long test suites
  such as test_io or test_subprocess.

- Issue #12624: It is now possible to fail after the first failure when
  running in verbose mode (``-v`` or ``-W``), by using the ``--failfast``

  tests.

- Issue #12496: Install test/capath directory to prevent test_connect_capath
  testcase failure in test_ssl.

  parent process.

- Issue #8716: Avoid crashes caused by Aqua Tk on OSX when attempting to run
  test_tk or test_ttk_guionly under a username that is not currently logged
  in to the console windowserver (as may be the case under buildbot or ssh).

-------

- Issue #12467: warnings: fix a race condition if a warning is emitted at
  shutdown, if globals()['__file__'] is None.

Tests
-----

What's New in Python 3.2.1 release candidate 2?
===============================================

*Release date: 03-Jul-2011*

  the following case: sys.stdin.read() stopped with CTRL+d (end of file),
  raw_input() interrupted by CTRL+c.

- Issue #9670: Increase the default stack size for secondary threads on Mac OS X
  and FreeBSD to reduce the chances of a crash instead of a "maximum recursion
  depth" RuntimeError exception (patch by Ronald Oussoren).

Library
-------

- Issue #12147: Adjust the new-in-3.2 smtplib.send_message method for better
  conformance to the RFCs: correctly handle Sender and Resent headers.

  also opens XML files for the parser in binary mode instead of the text mode to
  avoid encoding issues.

- Issue #12451: doctest.debug_script() doesn't create a temporary file anymore
  to avoid encoding issues.

- Issue #12451: pydoc.synopsis() now reads the encoding cookie if available, to

  encoding cookie, instead of opening it in UTF-8.

- Issue #9516: On Mac OS X, change Distutils to no longer globally attempt to
  check or set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable for the
  interpreter process.  This could cause failures in non-Distutils subprocesses
  and was unreliable since tests or user programs could modify the interpreter
  environment after Distutils set it.  Instead, have Distutils set the the
  deployment target only in the environment of each build subprocess.  It is
  still possible to globally override the default by setting
  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET before launching the interpreter; its value must be
  greater or equal to the default value, the value with which the interpreter
  was built.

- Issue #12383: Fix subprocess module with env={}: don't copy the environment
  variables, start with an empty environment.

- Issue #11584: email.header.decode_header no longer fails if the header passed
  to it is a Header object, and Header/make_header no longer fail if given

  Mher Movsisyan.

- Issue #12175: RawIOBase.readall() now returns None if read() returns None.

  their encode() method anymore, but continue to call the reset() method if the
  final argument is True.

- Issue #5715: In socketserver, close the server socket in the child process.

- Correct lookup of __dir__ on objects. Among other things, this causes errors
  besides AttributeError found on lookup to be propagated.

  to be able to unload the module.

- Issue #12065: connect_ex() on an SSL socket now returns the original errno
  when the socket's timeout expires (it used to return None).

  Kitada.

- Issue #12221: Replace pyexpat.__version__ with the Python version.

  os.lchflags() are once again built on systems that support these functions
  (*BSD and OS X).  Also add new stat file flags for OS X (UF_HIDDEN and
  UF_COMPRESSED).

- Issue #11217: For 64-bit/32-bit Mac OS X universal framework builds, ensure
  "make install" creates symlinks in --prefix bin for the "-32" files in the
  framework bin directory like the installer does.


Tests
-----

- Issue #12407: Explicitly skip test_capi.EmbeddingTest under Windows.

- Issue #12400: regrtest -W doesn't rerun the tests twice anymore, but captures
  the output and displays it on failure instead. regrtest -v doesn't print the
  error twice anymore if there is only one error.

  of test_distutils is no longer silently skipped when run outside of a build
  directory.

  which was a regression relative to Python2.  Unlike Python2, the last line of
  the folded body now ends with a carriage return.

  execution. Patch by Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #11569: use absolute path to the sysctl command in multiprocessing to
  ensure that it will be found regardless of the shell PATH. This ensures that
  multiprocessing.cpu_count works on default installs of MacOSX.

- Issue #11501: disutils.archive_utils.make_zipfile no longer fails if zlib is
  not installed. Instead, the zipfile.ZIP_STORED compression is used to create

- Issue #11121: Fix building with --enable-shared.

Tests
-----

- Issue #10971: test_zipimport_support is once again compatible with the refleak

What's New in Python 3.2 Release Candidate 2?
=============================================

*Release date: 30-Jan-2011*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10451: memoryview objects could allow to mutate a readable buffer.
  Initial patch by Ross Lagerwall.

Library
-------

- Issue #9124: mailbox now accepts binary input and reads and writes mailbox
  files in binary mode, using the email package's binary support to parse
  arbitrary email messages.  StringIO and text file input is deprecated,
  and string input fails early if non-ASCII characters are used, where
  previously it would fail when the email was processed in a later step.

- Issue #10845: Mitigate the incompatibility between the multiprocessing
  module on Windows and the use of package, zipfile or directory execution
  by special casing main modules that actually *are* called __main__.py.

- Issue #11045: Protect logging call against None argument.

- Issue #11052: Correct IDLE menu accelerators on Mac OS X for Save
  commands.

- Issue #11053: Fix IDLE "Syntax Error" windows to behave as in 2.x,
  preventing a confusing hung appearance on OS X with the windows
  obscured.

- Issue #10940: Workaround an IDLE hang on Mac OS X 10.6 when using the
  menu accelerators for Open Module, Go to Line, and New Indent Width.
  The accelerators still work but no longer appear in the menu items.

- Issue #10989: Fix a crash on SSLContext.load_verify_locations(None, True).

- Issue #11020: Command-line pyclbr was broken because of missing 2-to-3
  conversion.

- Issue #11019: Fixed BytesGenerator so that it correctly handles a Message
  with a None body.

- Issue #11014: Make 'filter' argument in tarfile.Tarfile.add() into a
  keyword-only argument.  The preceding positional argument was deprecated,
  so it made no sense to add filter as a positional argument.

- Issue #11004: Repaired edge case in deque.count().

- Issue #10974: IDLE no longer crashes if its recent files list includes files
  with non-ASCII characters in their path names.

- Have hashlib.algorithms_available and hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed both
  return sets instead of one returning a tuple and the other a frozenset.

- Issue #10987: Fix the recursion limit handling in the _pickle module.

- Issue #10983: Fix several bugs making tunnel requests in http.client.

- Issue #10955: zipimport uses ASCII encoding instead of cp437 to decode
  filenames, at bootstrap, if the codec registry is not ready yet. It is still
  possible to have non-ASCII filenames using the Unicode flag (UTF-8 encoding)
  for all file entries in the ZIP file.

- Issue #10949: Improved robustness of rotating file handlers.

- Issue #10955: Fix a potential crash when trying to mmap() a file past its
  length.  Initial patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10898: Allow compiling the posix module when the C library defines
  a symbol named FSTAT.

- Issue #10980: the HTTP server now encodes headers with iso-8859-1 (latin1)
  encoding.  This is the preferred encoding of PEP 3333 and the base encoding
  of HTTP 1.1.

- To match the behaviour of HTTP server, the HTTP client library now also
  encodes headers with iso-8859-1 (latin1) encoding.  It was already doing
  that for incoming headers which makes this behaviour now consistent in
  both incoming and outgoing direction.

- Issue #9509: argparse now properly handles IOErrors raised by
  argparse.FileType.

- Issue #10961: The new pydoc server now better handles exceptions raised
  during request handling.

- Issue #10680: Fix mutually exclusive arguments for argument groups in
  argparse.

Build
-----

- Issue #11054: Allow Mac OS X installer builds to again work on 10.5 with
  the system-provided Python.


What's New in Python 3.2 Release Candidate 1
============================================

  class.

- Issue #8020: Avoid a crash where the small objects allocator would read
  non-Python managed memory while it is being modified by another thread.  Patch
  by Matt Bandy.

- Issue #10841: On Windows, set the binary mode on stdin, stdout, stderr and all
  io.FileIO objects (to not translate newlines, \r\n <=> \n).  The Python parser
  translates newlines (\r\n => \n).

- Remove buffer API from stable ABI for now, see #10181.

- Issue #8651: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise an OverflowError if the file
  doesn't have PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN define and the size doesn't fit in an int
  (length bigger than 2^31-1 bytes).

- Issue #9015, #9611: FileIO.readinto(), FileIO.write(), os.write() and
  stdprinter.write() clamp the length to INT_MAX on Windows.

- Issue #8278: On Windows and with a NTFS filesystem, os.stat() and os.utime()
  can now handle dates after 2038.

- Issue #10780: PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilename() and
  PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilename() decode the filename from the
  filesystem encoding instead of UTF-8.

- Issue #10779: PyErr_WarnExplicit() decodes the filename from the filesystem
  encoding instead of UTF-8.

- Add sys.flags attribute for the new -q command-line option.

- Issue #11506: Trying to assign to a bytes literal should result in a
  SyntaxError.

Library
-------

- Issue #10916: mmap should not segfault when a file is mapped using 0 as length
  and a non-zero offset, and an attempt to read past the end of file is made
  (IndexError is raised instead).  Patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10154, #10090: change the normalization of UTF-8 to "UTF-8" instead
  of "UTF8" in the locale module as the latter is not supported MacOSX and OpenBSD.

- Issue #10684: shutil.move used to delete a folder on case insensitive
  filesystems when the source and destination name where the same except
  for the case.

- Issue #10907: Warn OS X 10.6 IDLE users to use ActiveState Tcl/Tk 8.5, rather
  than the currently problematic Apple-supplied one, when running with the
  64-/32-bit installer variant.

- Issue #4953: cgi.FieldStorage and cgi.parse() parse the request as bytes, not
  as unicode, and accept binary files. Add encoding and errors attributes to
  cgi.FieldStorage. Patch written by Pierre Quentel (with many inputs by Glenn
  Linderman).

- Add encoding and errors arguments to urllib.parse_qs() and urllib.parse_qsl().

- Issue #10899: No function type annotations in the standard library.  Removed
  function type annotations from _pyio.py.

- Issue #10875: Update Regular Expression HOWTO; patch by 'SilentGhost'.

- Issue #10872: The repr() of TextIOWrapper objects now includes the mode
  if available.

- Issue #10869: Fixed bug where ast.increment_lineno modified the root node
  twice.

- Issue #5871: email.header.Header.encode now raises an error if any
  continuation line in the formatted value has no leading white space and looks
  like a header.  Since Generator uses Header to format all headers, this check
  is made for all headers in any serialized message at serialization time.  This
  provides protection against header injection attacks.

- Issue #10859: Make ``contextlib.GeneratorContextManager`` officially
  private by renaming it to ``_GeneratorContextManager``.

- Issue #10042: Fixed the total_ordering decorator to handle cross-type
  comparisons that could lead to infinite recursion.

- Issue #10686: the email package now :rfc:`2047`\ -encodes headers with
  non-ASCII bytes (parsed by a BytesParser) when doing conversion to 7bit-clean
  presentation, instead of replacing them with ?s.

- email.header.Header was incorrectly encoding folding whitespace when
  rfc2047-encoding header values with embedded newlines, leaving them without
  folding whitespace.  It now uses the continuation_ws, as it does for
  continuation lines that it creates itself.

- Issue #1777412, #10827: Changed the rules for 2-digit years. The
  time.asctime(), time.ctime() and time.strftime() functions will now format
  any year when ``time.accept2dyear`` is False and will accept years >= 1000
  otherwise. ``time.mktime`` and ``time.strftime`` now accept full range
  supported by the OS. With Visual Studio or on Solaris, the year is limited to
  the range [1; 9999]. Conversion of 2-digit years to 4-digit is deprecated.

- Issue #7858: Raise an error properly when os.utime() fails under Windows
  on an existing file.

- Issue #3839: wsgiref should not override a Content-Length header set by
  the application.  Initial patch by Clovis Fabricio.

- Issue #10492: bdb.Bdb.run() only traces the execution of the code, not the
  compilation (if the input is a string).

- Issue #7995: When calling accept() on a socket with a timeout, the returned
  socket is now always blocking, regardless of the operating system.

- Issue #10756: atexit normalizes the exception before displaying it. Patch by
  Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #10790: email.header.Header.append's charset logic now works correctly
  for charsets whose output codec is different from its input codec.

- Issue #10819: SocketIO.name property returns -1 when its closed, instead of
  raising a ValueError, to fix repr().

- Issue #8650: zlib.compress() and zlib.decompress() raise an OverflowError if
  the input buffer length doesn't fit into an unsigned int (length bigger than
  2^32-1 bytes).

- Issue #6643: Reinitialize locks held within the threading module after fork to
  avoid a potential rare deadlock or crash on some platforms.

- Issue #10806, issue #9905: Fix subprocess pipes when some of the standard file
  descriptors (0, 1, 2) are closed in the parent process.  Initial patch by Ross
  Lagerwall.

- `unittest.TestCase` can be instantiated without a method name; for simpler
  exploration from the interactive interpreter.

- Issue #10798: Reject supporting concurrent.futures if the system has too
  few POSIX semaphores.

- Issue #10807: Remove base64, bz2, hex, quopri, rot13, uu and zlib codecs from
  the codec aliases. They are still accessible via codecs.lookup().

- Issue #10801: In zipfile, support different encodings for the header and the
  filenames.

- Issue #6285: IDLE no longer crashes on missing help file; patch by Scott
  David Daniels.

- Fix collections.OrderedDict.setdefault() so that it works in subclasses that
  define __missing__().

- Issue #10786: unittest.TextTestRunner default stream no longer bound at import
  time. `sys.stderr` now looked up at instantiation time.  Fix contributed by
  Mark Roddy.

- Issue #10753: Characters ';', '=' and ',' in the PATH_INFO environment variable
  won't be quoted when the URI is constructed by the wsgiref.util's request_uri
  method. According to RFC 3986, these characters can be a part of params in
  PATH component of URI and need not be quoted.

- Issue #10738: Fix webbrowser.Opera.raise_opts.

- Issue #9824: SimpleCookie now encodes , and ; in values to cater to how
  browsers actually parse cookies.

- Issue #9333: os.symlink now available regardless of user privileges.  The
  function now raises OSError on Windows >=6.0 when the user is unable to create
  symbolic links. XP and 2003 still raise NotImplementedError.

- Issue #10783: struct.pack() no longer implicitly encodes unicode to UTF-8.

- Issue #10730: Add SVG mime types to mimetypes module.

- Issue #10768: Make the Tkinter ScrolledText widget work again.

- Issue #10774: test_logging now removes temp files created during tests.

- Issue #5258/#10642: if site.py encounters a .pth file that generates an error,
  it now prints the filename, line number, and traceback to stderr and skips
  the rest of that individual file, instead of stopping processing entirely.

- Issue #10763: subprocess.communicate() closes stdout and stderr if both are
  pipes (bug specific to Windows).

- Issue #1693546: fix email.message RFC 2231 parameter encoding to be in better
  compliance (no "s around encoded values).

- Improved the diff message in the unittest module's assertCountEqual().

- Issue #1155362: email.utils.parsedate_tz now handles a missing space before
  the '-' of a timezone field as well as before a '+'.

- Issue #4871: The zipfile module now gives a more useful error message if
  an attempt is made to use a string to specify the archive password.

- Issue #10750: The ``raw`` attribute of buffered IO objects is now read-only.

- Deprecated assertDictContainsSubset() in the unittest module.

C-API
-----

- Issue #10913: Deprecate misleading functions PyEval_AcquireLock() and
  PyEval_ReleaseLock().  The thread-state aware APIs should be used instead.

- Issue #10333: Remove ancient GC API, which has been deprecated since Python
  2.2.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 4?
=================================

*Release date: 13-Nov-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10372: Import the warnings module only after the IO library is
  initialized, so as to avoid bootstrap issues with the '-W' option.

- Issue #10293: Remove obsolete field in the PyMemoryView structure, unused
  undocumented value PyBUF_SHADOW, and strangely-looking code in
  PyMemoryView_GetContiguous.

- Issue #6081: Add str.format_map(), similar to ``str.format(**mapping)``.

- If FileIO.__init__ fails, close the file descriptor.

- Issue #10221: dict.pop(k) now has a key error message that includes the
  missing key (same message d[k] returns for missing keys).

  data (including local variables caught in the stack trace) alive infinitely.

- Issue #10186: Fix the SyntaxError caret when the offset is equal to the length
  of the offending line.

- Issue #10089: Add support for arbitrary -X options on the command line.  They
  can be retrieved through a new attribute ``sys._xoptions``.

- Issue #4388: On Mac OS X, decode command line arguments from UTF-8, instead of
  the locale encoding.  If the LANG (and LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE) environment
  variable is not set, the locale encoding is ISO-8859-1, whereas most programs
  (including Python) expect UTF-8.  Python already uses UTF-8 for the filesystem
  encoding and to encode command line arguments on this OS.

- Issue #9713, #10114: Parser functions (e.g. PyParser_ASTFromFile) expect
  filenames encoded to the filesystem encoding with the surrogateescape error
  handler (to support undecodable bytes), instead of UTF-8 in strict mode.

- Issue #9997: Don't let the name "top" have special significance in scope
  resolution.

- Issue #9862: Compensate for broken PIPE_BUF in AIX by hard coding its value as
  the default 512 when compiling on AIX.

  there are non-base64 alphabet characters in the input.

- Issue #10386: Add __all__ to token module; this simplifies importing in
  tokenize module and prevents leaking of private names through ``import *``.

- Issue #4471: Properly shutdown socket in IMAP.shutdown().  Patch by Lorenzo
  M. Catucci.

- Fix IMAP.login() to work properly.

- Issue #9244: multiprocessing pool worker processes could terminate
  unexpectedly if the return value of a task could not be pickled.  Only the
  ``repr`` of such errors are now sent back, wrapped in an
  ``MaybeEncodingError`` exception.

- Issue #9244: The ``apply_async()`` and ``map_async()`` methods of
  ``multiprocessing.Pool`` now accepts a ``error_callback`` argument.  This can
  be a callback with the signature ``callback(exc)``, which will be called if
  the target raises an exception.

  sockets now has additional items such as ``issuer`` and ``notBefore``.

- ``usenetrc`` is now false by default for NNTP objects.

- Issue #1926: Add support for NNTP over SSL on port 563, as well as STARTTLS.
  Patch by Andrew Vant.

- Issue #10335: Add tokenize.open(), detect the file encoding using
  tokenize.detect_encoding() and open it in read only mode.

- Issue #10321: Add support for binary data to smtplib.SMTP.sendmail, and a new
  method send_message to send an email.message.Message object.

- Issue #6011: sysconfig and distutils.sysconfig use the surrogateescape error
  handler to parse the Makefile file.  Avoid a UnicodeDecodeError if the source
  code directory name contains a non-ASCII character and the locale encoding is
  ASCII.

  encoding, instead of the locale encoding.  Patch written by Alexander
  Belopolsky.

  environment better, and to correct unicode environment values for WSGI 1.0.1.

- Issue #10281: nntplib now returns None for absent fields in the OVER/XOVER
  response, instead of raising an exception.

- wsgiref now implements and validates PEP 3333, rather than an experimental
  extension of PEP 333.  (Note: earlier versions of Python 3.x may have
  incorrectly validated some non-compliant applications as WSGI compliant; if
  your app validates with Python <3.2b1+, but not on this version, it is likely
  the case that your app was not compliant.)

- Issue #10280: NNTP.nntp_version should reflect the highest version advertised
  by the server.

- Issue #10184: Touch directories only once when extracting a tarfile.

- Issue #10199: New package, ``turtledemo`` now contains selected demo scripts

- Issue #10233: Close file objects in a timely manner in the tarfile module and
  its test suite.

  deallocated without explicit closing.  These warnings are silenced by default,
  except in pydebug mode.

  encode method now support a 'linesep' argument.

- Issue #5639: Add a *server_hostname* argument to ``SSLContext.wrap_socket`` in
  order to support the TLS SNI extension.  ``HTTPSConnection`` and ``urlopen()``
  also use this argument, so that HTTPS virtual hosts are now supported.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 09-Oct-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10068: Global objects which have reference cycles with their module's
  dict are now cleared again. This causes issue #7140 to appear again.

- Issue #9738: Document PyErr_SetString() and PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename()
  encodings.

- ast.literal_eval() can now handle negative numbers.  It is also a little more
  liberal in what it accepts without compromising the safety of the evaluation.
  For example, 3j+4 and 3+4+5 are both accepted.

- Issue #10006: type.__abstractmethods__ now raises an AttributeError.  As a
  result metaclasses can now be ABCs (see #9533).

- Issue #8670: ctypes.c_wchar supports non-BMP characters with 32 bits wchar_t.

- Issue #8670: PyUnicode_AsWideChar() and PyUnicode_AsWideCharString() replace
  UTF-16 surrogate pairs by single non-BMP characters for 16 bits Py_UNICODE and
  32 bits wchar_t (eg. Linux in narrow build).

- Issue #10003: Allow handling of SIGBREAK on Windows. Fixes a regression
  introduced by issue #9324.

- Issue #9979: Create function PyUnicode_AsWideCharString().

- Issue #7397: Mention that importlib.import_module() is probably what someone
  really wants to be using in __import__'s docstring.

- Issue #8521: Allow CreateKeyEx, OpenKeyEx, and DeleteKeyEx functions of winreg
  to use named arguments.

- Issue #9930: Remove bogus subtype check that was causing (e.g.)
  float.__rdiv__(2.0, 3) to return NotImplemented instead of the expected 1.5.

- Issue #9808: Implement os.getlogin for Windows. Patch by Jon Anglin.

- Issue #9901: Destroying the GIL in Py_Finalize() can fail if some other
  threads are still running.  Instead, reinitialize the GIL on a second call to
  Py_Initialize().

- All SyntaxErrors now have a column offset and therefore a caret when the error
  is printed.

- Issue #9252: PyImport_Import no longer uses a fromlist hack to return the
  module that was imported, but instead gets the module from sys.modules.

- Issue #9213: The range type_items now provides index() and count() methods, to
  conform to the Sequence ABC.  Patch by Daniel Urban and Daniel Stutzbach.

- Issue #7994: Issue a PendingDeprecationWarning if object.__format__ is called
  with a non-empty format string.  This is an effort to future-proof user
  code. If a derived class does not currently implement __format__ but later
  adds its own __format__, it would most likely break user code that had
  supplied a format string.  This will be changed to a DeprecationWaring in
  Python 3.3 and it will be an error in Python 3.4.

- Issue #9828: Destroy the GIL in Py_Finalize(), so that it gets properly
  re-created on a subsequent call to Py_Initialize().  The problem (a crash)
  wouldn't appear in 3.1 or 2.7 where the GIL's structure is more trivial.

- Issue #9210: Configure option --with-wctype-functions was removed.  Using the
  functions from the libc caused the methods .upper() and lower() to become
  locale aware and created subtly wrong results.

- Issue #9738: PyUnicode_FromFormat() and PyErr_Format() raise an error on a
  non-ASCII byte in the format string.

- Issue #4617: Previously it was illegal to delete a name from the local
  namespace if it occurs as a free variable in a nested block.  This limitation
  of the compiler has been lifted, and a new opcode introduced (DELETE_DEREF).

- Issue #9804: ascii() now always represents unicode surrogate pairs as a single
  ``\UXXXXXXXX``, regardless of whether the character is printable or not.
  Also, the "backslashreplace" error handler now joins surrogate pairs into a
  single character on UCS-2 builds.

- Issue #9757: memoryview objects get a release() method to release the
  underlying buffer (previously this was only done when deallocating the
  memoryview), and gain support for the context management protocol.

- Issue #9797: pystate.c wrongly assumed that zero couldn't be a valid
  thread-local storage key.

Library
-------

- Issue #2236: distutils' mkpath ignored the mode parameter.

- Fix typo in one sdist option (medata-check).

- Issue #9199: Fix incorrect use of distutils.cmd.Command.announce.

- Issue #1718574: Fix options that were supposed to accept arguments but did
  not in build_clib.

- Issue #9437: Fix building C extensions with non-default LDFLAGS.

- Issue #4661: email can now parse bytes input and generate either converted
  7bit output or bytes output.  Email version bumped to 5.1.0.

- Issue #1589: Add ssl.match_hostname(), to help implement server identity
  verification for higher-level protocols.

- Issue #9759: GzipFile now raises ValueError when an operation is attempted
  after the file is closed.  Patch by Jeffrey Finkelstein.

- Issue #9042: Fix interaction of custom translation classes and caching in
  gettext.

- Issue #6706: asyncore.dispatcher now provides a handle_accepted() method
  returning a (sock, addr) pair which is called when a connection has been
  established with a new remote endpoint.  This is supposed to be used as a
  replacement for old handle_accept() and avoids the user to call accept()
  directly.

- Issue #9065: tarfile no longer uses "root" as the default for the uname and
  gname field.

- Issue #8980: Fixed a failure in distutils.command check that was shadowed by
  an environment that does not have docutils.  Patch by Arfrever.

- Issue #1050268: parseaddr now correctly quotes double quote and backslash
  characters that appear inside quoted strings in email addresses.

- Issue #10004: quoprimime no longer generates a traceback when confronted with
  invalid characters after '=' in a Q-encoded word.

- Issue #1491: BaseHTTPServer nows send a ``100 Continue`` response before
  sending a 200 OK for the Expect: 100-continue request header.

- Issue #9360: Cleanup and improvements to the nntplib module.  The API now
  conforms to the philosophy of bytes and unicode separation in Python 3.  A
  test suite has also been added.

- Issue #9962: GzipFile now has the peek() method.

- Issue #9090: When a socket with a timeout fails with EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN,
  retry the select() loop instead of bailing out.  This is because select() can
  incorrectly report a socket as ready for reading (for example, if it received
  some data with an invalid checksum).

- Issue #3612: Added new types to ctypes.wintypes. (CHAR and pointers)

- Issue #9950: Fix socket.sendall() crash or misbehaviour when a signal is
  received.  Now sendall() properly calls signal handlers if necessary, and
  retries sending if these returned successfully, including on sockets with a
  timeout.

- Issue #9947: logging: Fixed locking bug in stopListening.

- Issue #9945: logging: Fixed locking bugs in addHandler/removeHandler.

- Issue #9936: Fixed executable lines' search in the trace module.

- Issue #9790: Rework imports necessary for samefile and sameopenfile
  in ntpath.

- Issue #9928: Properly initialize the types exported by the bz2 module.

- Issue #1675951: Allow GzipFile to work with unseekable file objects.  Patch by
  Florian Festi.

- Logging: Added QueueListener class to facilitate logging usage for
  performance-critical threads.

- Issue #9916: Add some missing errno symbols.

- Issue #9877: Expose sysconfig.get_makefile_filename()

- logging: Added hasHandlers() method to Logger and LoggerAdapter.

- Issue #9908: Fix os.stat() on bytes paths under Windows 7.

- Issue #2643: msync() is not called anymore when deallocating an open mmap
  object, only munmap().

- logging: Changed LoggerAdapter implementation internally, to make it easier to
  subclass in a useful way.

- logging: hasHandlers method was added to Logger, and isEnabledFor,
  getEffectiveLevel, hasHandlers and setLevel were added to LoggerAdapter.
  LoggerAdapter was introduced into the unit tests for logging.

- Issue #1686: Fix string.Template when overriding the pattern attribute.

- Issue #9854: SocketIO objects now observe the RawIOBase interface in
  non-blocking mode: they return None when an operation would block (instead of
  raising an exception).

- Issue #1730136: Fix the comparison between a tk.font.Font and an object of
  another kind.

- Issue #9441: logging has better coverage for rotating file handlers.

- Issue #9865: collections.OrderedDict now has a __sizeof__ method.

- Issue #9854: The default read() implementation in io.RawIOBase now handles
  non-blocking readinto() returning None correctly.

- Issue #1552: socket.socketpair() now returns regular socket.socket objects
  supporting the whole socket API (rather than the "raw" _socket.socket
  objects).

- Issue #9853: Fix the signature of SSLSocket.recvfrom() and SSLSocket.sendto()
  to match the corresponding socket methods.

- Issue #9840: Added a decorator to reprlib for wrapping __repr__ methods to make
  them handle recursive calls within the same thread.

- logging: Enhanced HTTPHandler with secure and credentials initializers.

- Issue #767645: Set os.path.supports_unicode_filenames to True on Mac OS X.

- Issue #9837: The read() method of ZipExtFile objects (as returned by
  ZipFile.open()) could return more bytes than requested.

- Issue #9826: OrderedDict.__repr__ can now handle self-referential values:
  d['x'] = d.

- Issue #9825: Using __del__ in the definition of collections.OrderedDict made
  it possible for the user to create self-referencing ordered dictionaries which
  become permanently uncollectable GC garbage.  Reinstated the Python 3.1
  approach of using weakref proxies so that reference cycles never get created
  in the first place.

- Issue #9579, #9580: Fix os.confstr() for value longer than 255 bytes and
  encode the value with filesystem encoding and surrogateescape (instead of
  utf-8 in strict mode) . Patch written by David Watson.

- Issue #9632: Remove sys.setfilesystemencoding() function: use PYTHONFSENCODING
  environment variable to set the filesystem encoding at Python startup.
  sys.setfilesystemencoding() creates inconsistencies because it is unable to
  reencode all filenames in all objects.

- Issue #9410: Various optimizations to the pickle module, leading to speedups
  up to 4x (depending on the benchmark).  Mostly ported from Unladen Swallow;
  initial patch by Alexandre Vassalotti.

- The pprint module now supports printing OrderedDicts in their given order
  (formerly, it would sort the keys).

- Logging: Added QueueHandler class to facilitate logging usage with
  multiprocessing.

- Issue #9707: Rewritten reference implementation of threading.local which is
  friendlier towards reference cycles.  This change is not normally visible
  since an optimized C implementation (_thread._local) is used instead.

- Issue #6394: os.getppid() is now supported on Windows.  Note that it will
  still return the id of the parent process after it has exited.  This process
  id may even have been reused by another unrelated process.

- Issue #9792: In case of connection failure, socket.create_connection() would
  swallow the exception and raise a new one, making it impossible to fetch the
  original errno, or to filter timeout errors.  Now the original error is
  re-raised.

- Issue #9758: When fcntl.ioctl() was called with mutable_flag set to True, and
  the passed buffer was exactly 1024 bytes long, the buffer wouldn't be updated
  back after the system call.  Original patch by Brian Brazil.

- Updates to the random module:

  * Document which parts of the module are guaranteed to stay the same across
    versions and which parts are subject to change.

  * Update the seed() method to use all of the bits in a string instead of just
    the hash value.  This makes better use of the seed value and assures the
    seeding is platform independent.  Issue #7889.

  * Improved the random()-->integer algorithm used in choice(), shuffle(),
    sample(), randrange(), and randint().  Formerly, it used int(n*random())
    which has a slight bias whenever n is not a power of two.  Issue #9025.

  * Improved documentation of arguments to randrange().  Issue #9379.

- collections.OrderedDict now supports a new method for repositioning keys to
  either end.

- Issue #9754: Similarly to assertRaises and assertRaisesRegexp, unittest test
  cases now also have assertWarns and assertWarnsRegexp methods to check that a
  given warning type was triggered by the code under test.

- Issue #5506: BytesIO objects now have a getbuffer() method exporting a view of
  their contents without duplicating them.  The view is both readable and
  writable.

- Issue #7566: Implement os.path.sameopenfile for Windows.

- Issue #9293: I/O streams now raise ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` when an
  unsupported operation is attempted (for example, writing to a file open only
  for reading).

- hashlib has two new constant attributes: algorithms_guaranteed and
  algorithms_avaiable that respectively list the names of hash algorithms
  guaranteed to exist in all Python implementations and the names of hash
  algorithms available in the current process.

- A new package ``concurrent.futures`` as defined by PEP 3148.

C-API
-----

- Add PyErr_SyntaxLocationEx, which supports passing a column offset.

- Issue #9834: Don't segfault in PySequence_GetSlice, PySequence_SetSlice, or
  PySequence_DelSlice when the object doesn't have any mapping operations
  defined.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #9188: The gdb extension now handles correctly narrow (UCS2) as well as
  wide (UCS4) unicode builds for both the host interpreter (embedded inside gdb)
  and the interpreter under test.

Tests
-----

- Issue #9308: Added tests for importing encoded modules that do not
  depend on specific stdlib modules being encoded in a certain way.

- Issue #1051: Add a script (Lib/test/make_ssl_certs.py) to generate the custom
  certificate and private key files used by SSL-related certs.

- Issue #9978: Wait until subprocess completes initialization. (Win32KillTests
  in test_os)

- Issue #7110: regrtest now sends test failure reports and single-failure
  tracebacks to stderr rather than stdout.

- Issue #9628: fix runtests.sh -x option so more than one test can be excluded.

- Issue #9899: Fix test_tkinter.test_font on various platforms.  Patch by Ned
  Deily.

- Issue #9894: Do not hardcode ENOENT in test_subprocess.

- Issue #9315: Added tests for the trace module.  Patch by Eli Bendersky.

- Issue #9323: Make test.regrtest.__file__ absolute, this was not always the
  case when running profile or trace, for example.

- Issue #9568: Fix test_urllib2_localnet on OS X 10.3.

Build
-----

- Issue #10062: Allow building on platforms which do not have sem_timedwait.

- Issue #10054: Some platforms provide uintptr_t in inttypes.h.  Patch by Akira
  Kitada.

- Issue #10055: Make json C89-compliant in UCS4 mode.

- Issue #9552: Avoid unnecessary rebuild of OpenSSL. (Windows)

- Issue #1633863: Don't ignore $CC under AIX.

- Issue #9810: Compile bzip2 source files in Python's project file directly. It
  used to be built with bzip2's makefile.

- Issue #9848: Stopping trying to build _weakref in setup.py as it is a built-in
  module.

- Issue #9806: python-config now has an ``--extension-suffix`` option that
  outputs the suffix for dynamic libraries including the ABI version name
  defined by PEP 3149.

- Issue #941346: Improve the build process under AIX and allow Python to be
  built as a shared library.  Patch by Sébastien Sablé.

- Issue #4026: Make the fcntl extension build under AIX.  Patch by Sébastien
  Sablé.

- Issue #9701: The MacOSX installer can patch the shell profile to ensure that
  the "bin" directory inside the framework is on the shell's search path. This
  feature now also supports the ZSH shell.


What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 05-Sep-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #9225: Remove the ROT_FOUR and DUP_TOPX opcode, the latter replaced by
  the new (and simpler) DUP_TOP_TWO.  Performance isn't changed, but our
  bytecode is a bit simplified.  Patch by Demur Rumed.

- Issue #9766: Rename poorly named variables exposed by _warnings to prevent
  confusion with the proper variables names from 'warnings' itself.

- Issue #9212: dict_keys and dict_items now provide the isdisjoint() method, to
  conform to the Set ABC.  Patch by Daniel Urban.

- Issue #9737: Fix a crash when trying to delete a slice or an item from a
  memoryview object.

- Issue #9549: sys.setdefaultencoding() and PyUnicode_SetDefaultEncoding() are
  now removed, since their effect was inexistent in 3.x (the default encoding is
  hardcoded to utf-8 and cannot be changed).

- Issue #7415: PyUnicode_FromEncodedObject() now uses the new buffer API
  properly.  Patch by Stefan Behnel.

- Issue #5553: The Py_LOCAL_INLINE macro now results in inlining on most
  platforms.  Previously, it inlined only when using Microsoft Visual C.

- Issue #9712: Fix tokenize on identifiers that start with non-ascii names.

- Issue #9688: __basicsize__ and __itemsize__ must be accessed as Py_ssize_t.

- Issue #9684: Added a definition for SIZEOF_WCHAR_T to PC/pyconfig.h, to match
  the pyconfig.h generated by configure on other systems.

- Issue #9666: Only catch AttributeError in hasattr(). All other exceptions that
  occur during attribute lookup are now propagated to the caller.

- Issue #8622: Add PYTHONFSENCODING environment variable to override the
  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #5127: The C functions that access the Unicode Database now accept and
  return characters from the full Unicode range, even on narrow unicode builds
  (Py_UNICODE_TOLOWER, Py_UNICODE_ISDECIMAL, and others).  A visible difference
  in Python is that unicodedata.numeric() now returns the correct value for
  large code points, and repr() may consider more characters as printable.

- Issue #9425: Create PyModule_GetFilenameObject() function to get the filename
  as a unicode object, instead of a byte string. Function needed to support
  unencodable filenames. Deprecate PyModule_GetFilename() in favor on the new
  function.

- Issue #8063: Call _PyGILState_Init() earlier in Py_InitializeEx().

- Issue #9612: The set object is now 64-bit clean under Windows.

- Issue #8202: sys.argv[0] is now set to '-m' instead of '-c' when searching for
  the module file to be executed with the -m command line option.

- Issue #9599: Create PySys_FormatStdout() and PySys_FormatStderr() functions to
  write a message formatted by PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to sys.stdout and
  sys.stderr.

- Issue #9542: Create PyUnicode_FSDecoder() function, a ParseTuple converter:
  decode bytes objects to unicode using PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize(); str
  objects are output as-is.

- Issue #9203: Computed gotos are now enabled by default on supported compilers
  (which are detected by the configure script).  They can still be disable
  selectively by specifying --without-computed-gotos.

- Issue #9425: Create PyErr_WarnFormat() function, similar to PyErr_WarnEx() but
  use PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to format the warning message.

- Issue #8530: Prevent stringlib fastsearch from reading beyond the front of an
  array.

- Issue #5319: Print an error if flushing stdout fails at interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #9337: The str() of a float or complex number is now identical to its
  repr().

- Issue #9416: Fix some issues with complex formatting where the output with no
  type specifier failed to match the str output:

    - format(complex(-0.0, 2.0), '-') omitted the real part from the output,
    - format(complex(0.0, 2.0), '-') included a sign and parentheses.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8013: time.asctime and time.ctime no longer call system
  asctime and ctime functions.  The year range for time.asctime is now
  1900 through maxint.  The range for time.ctime is the same as for
  time.localtime.  The string produced by these functions is longer
  than 24 characters when year is greater than 9999.

- Issue #6608: time.asctime is now checking struct tm fields its input
  before passing it to the system asctime.  Patch by MunSic Jeong.

- Issue #8734: Avoid crash in msvcrt.get_osfhandle() when an invalid file
  descriptor is provided.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #7736: Release the GIL around calls to opendir() and closedir() in the
  posix module.  Patch by Marcin Bachry.

- Issue #4835: make PyLong_FromSocket_t() and PyLong_AsSocket_t() private to the
  socket module, and fix the width of socket descriptors to be correctly
  detected under 64-bit Windows.

- Issue #1027206: Support IDNA in gethostbyname, gethostbyname_ex, getaddrinfo
  and gethostbyaddr.  getnameinfo is now restricted to numeric addresses as
  input.

- Issue #9214: Set operations on a KeysView or ItemsView in collections now
  correctly return a set.  Patch by Eli Bendersky.

- Issue #5737: Add Solaris-specific mnemonics in the errno module.  Patch by
  Matthew Ahrens.

- Restore GIL in nis_cat in case of error. Decode NIS data to fs encoding, using
  the surrogate error handler.

- Issue #665761: ``functools.reduce()`` will no longer mask exceptions other
  than ``TypeError`` raised by the iterator argument.

- Issue #9570: Use PEP 383 decoding in os.mknod and os.mkfifo.

- Issue #6915: Under Windows, os.listdir() didn't release the Global Interpreter
  Lock around all system calls.  Original patch by Ryan Kelly.

- Issue #8524: Add a detach() method to socket objects, so as to put the socket
  into the closed state without closing the underlying file descriptor.

- Issue #477863: Emit a ResourceWarning at shutdown if gc.garbage is not empty.

- Issue #6869: Fix a refcount problem in the _ctypes extension.

- Issue #5504: ctypes should now work with systems where mmap can't be
  PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC.

  module from working correctly with arrays of more than 2**31 elements.

- Fix memory leak in ssl._ssl._test_decode_cert.

- Issue #8065: Fix memory leak in readline module (from failure to free the
  result of history_get_history_state()).

- Issue #9450: Fix memory leak in readline.replace_history_item and
  readline.remove_history_item for readline version >= 5.0.

- Issue #8105: Validate file descriptor passed to mmap.mmap on Windows.

- Issue #8046: Add context manager protocol support and .closed property to mmap
  objects.

Library
-------

  memory consumption of said decoded objects when they use the same strings as
  keys.

- Issue #1100562: Fix deep-copying of objects derived from the list and dict
  types.  Patch by Michele Orrù and Björn Lindqvist.

- Issue #9753: Fixed socket.dup, which did not always work correctly on Windows.

- Issue #9421: Made the get<type> methods consistently accept the vars and

  for use with the statvfs() function.  Patch by Adam Jackson.

- Issue #8688: MANIFEST files created by distutils now include a magic comment
  indicating they are generated.  Manually maintained MANIFESTs without this
  marker will not be overwritten or removed.

- Issue #7467: when reading a file from a ZIP archive, its CRC is checked and a
  BadZipfile error is raised if it doesn't match (as used to be the case in
  Python 2.5 and earlier).

- Issue #9550: a BufferedReader could issue an additional read when the original
  read request had been satisfied, which could block indefinitely when the
  underlying raw IO channel was e.g. a socket.  Report and original patch by

  is how it is supposed to work, wget and curl do the same.  Previous behavior
  was wrong.

- Issue #6683: For SMTP logins we now try all authentication methods advertised
  by the server.  Many servers are buggy and advertise authentication methods
  they do not support in reality.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: 01-Aug-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #8991: convertbuffer() rejects discontigious buffers.

- Issue #7616: Fix copying of overlapping memoryview slices with the Intel
  compiler.

- Issue #8413: structsequence now subclasses tuple.

- Issue #8271: during the decoding of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, only the
  start byte and the continuation byte(s) are now considered invalid, instead of
  the number of bytes specified by the start byte.  E.g.:
  '\xf1\x80AB'.decode('utf-8', 'replace') now returns u'\ufffdAB' and replaces
  with U+FFFD only the start byte ('\xf1') and the continuation byte ('\x80')
  even if '\xf1' is the start byte of a 4-bytes sequence.  Previous versions
  returned a single u'\ufffd'.

- Issue #9011: A negated imaginary literal (e.g., "-7j") now has real part -0.0
  rather than 0.0.  So "-7j" is now exactly equivalent to "-(7j)".

- Be more specific in error messages about positional arguments.

- Issue #8949: "z" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions doesn't accept bytes
  objects, as described in the documentation.

- Issue #6543: Write the traceback in the terminal encoding instead of utf-8.
  Fix the encoding of the modules filename.  Patch written by Amaury Forgeot
  d'Arc.

- Issue #9011: Remove buggy and unnecessary (in 3.x) ST->AST compilation code
  dealing with unary minus applied to a constant.  The removed code was mutating
  the ST, causing a second compilation to fail.

- Issue #850997: mbcs encoding (Windows only) handles errors argument: strict
  mode raises unicode errors.  The encoder only supports "strict" and "replace"
  error handlers, the decoder only supports "strict" and "ignore" error
  handlers.  Patch written by Mark Hammond.

- Issue #8850: Remove "w" and "w#" formats from PyArg_Parse*() functions, use
  "w*" format instead. Add tests for "w*" format.

- Issue #8592: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise a TypeError for "y", "u" and "Z"
  formats if the string contains a null byte/character.  Write unit tests for
  string formats.

- Issue #7490: To facilitate sharing of doctests between 2.x and 3.x test
  suites, the IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL directive now also ignores the module
  location of the raised exception.

- Issue #8969: On Windows, use mbcs codec in strict mode to encode and decode
  filenames and enable os.fsencode().

- Issue #9058: Remove assertions about INT_MAX in UnicodeDecodeError.

- Issue #8941: Decoding big endian UTF-32 data in UCS-2 builds could crash the
  interpreter with characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (higher than
  0x10000).

- Issue #8950: (See also issue #5080).  Py_ArgParse*() functions now raise
  TypeError instead of giving a DeprecationWarning when a float is parsed using
  the 'L' code (for long long).  (All other integer codes already raise
  TypeError in this case.)

- Issue #8922: Normalize the encoding name in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() to
  enable shortcuts for upper case encoding name. Add also a shortcut for
  "iso-8859-1" in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() and PyUnicode_Decode().

- Issue #8838: Remove codecs.charbuffer_encode() function.  The buffer protocol
  doesn't support "char buffer" anymore in Python 3.

- Issue #8339: Remove "t#" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions, use "s#" or "s*"
  instead.  codecs.charbuffer_encode() now accepts modifiable buffer objects
  like bytearray.

- Issue #8837: Remove "O?" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions.  The format is no
  used anymore and it was never documented.

- In str.format(), raise a ValueError when indexes to arguments are too large.

- Issue #2844: Make int('42', n) consistently raise ValueError for invalid
  integers n (including n = -909).

- Issue #8188: Introduce a new scheme for computing hashes of numbers (instances
  of int, float, complex, decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction) that makes it
  easy to maintain the invariant that hash(x) == hash(y) whenever x and y have
  equal value.

- Issue #8748: Fix two issues with comparisons between complex and integer
  objects.  (1) The comparison could incorrectly return True in some cases
  (2**53+1 == complex(2**53) == 2**53), breaking transitivity of equality.
  (2) The comparison raised an OverflowError for large integers, leading to
  unpredictable exceptions when combining integers and complex objects in sets
  or dicts.

- Issue #8766: Initialize _warnings module before importing the first module.
  Fix a crash if an empty directory called "encodings" exists in sys.path.

- Issue #8589: Decode PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable with the file system
  encoding and surrogateescape error handler instead of the locale encoding to
  be consistent with os.environ.  Add PySys_AddWarnOptionUnicode() function.

- PyObject_Dump() encodes unicode objects to utf8 with backslashreplace (instead
  of strict) error handler to escape surrogates.

- Issue #8715: Create PyUnicode_EncodeFSDefault() function: Encode a Unicode
  object to Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding with the "surrogateescape" error
  handler, and return bytes.  If Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding is not set, fall
  back to UTF-8.

- Enable shortcuts for common encodings in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() for any
  error handler, not only the default error handler (strict).

- Issue #8610: Load file system codec at startup, and display a fatal error on
  failure.  Set the file system encoding to utf-8 (instead of None) if getting
  the locale encoding failed, or if nl_langinfo(CODESET) function is missing.

- PyFile_FromFd() uses PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault() instead of
  PyUnicode_FromString() to support surrogates in the filename and use the right
  encoding.

- Issue #7507: Quote "!" in pipes.quote(); it is special to some shells.

- PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize() uses surrogateescape error handler.

- Issue #8419: Prevent the dict constructor from accepting non-string keyword
  arguments.

- Issue #8124: PySys_WriteStdout() and PySys_WriteStderr() don't execute
  indirectly Python signal handlers anymore because mywrite() ignores exceptions
  (KeyboardInterrupt).

- Issue #8092: Fix PyUnicode_EncodeUTF8() to support error handler producing
  unicode string (eg. backslashreplace).

- Issue #8485: PyUnicode_FSConverter() doesn't accept byteearray objects
  anymore, you have to convert your bytearray filenames to bytes.

- Issue #7332: Remove the 16KB stack-based buffer in
  PyMarshal_ReadLastObjectFromFile, which doesn't bring any noticeable benefit
  compared to the dynamic memory allocation fallback.  Patch by Charles-François
  Natali.

- Issue #8417: Raise an OverflowError when an integer larger than sys.maxsize is
  passed to bytes or bytearray.

- Issue #7301: Add environment variable $PYTHONWARNINGS.

- Issue #8329: Don't return the same lists from select.select when no fds are
  changed.

- Issue #8259: 1L << (2**31) no longer produces an 'outrageous shift error' on
  64-bit machines.  The shift count for either left or right shift is permitted
  to be up to sys.maxsize.

- Ensure that tokenization of identifiers is not affected by locale.

- Issue #1222585: Added LDCXXSHARED for C++ support. Patch by Arfrever.

- Raise a TypeError when trying to delete a T_STRING_INPLACE struct member.

- Issue #8211: Save/restore CFLAGS around AC_PROG_CC in configure.in, in case it
  is set.

- Issue #8226: sys.setfilesystemencoding() raises a LookupError if the encoding
  is unknown.

- Issue #1583863: A str subclass can now override the __str__ method.

- Issue #8014: Setting a T_UINT or T_PYSSIZET attribute of an object with
  PyMemberDefs could produce an internal error; raise TypeError instead.

- Issue #7845: Rich comparison methods on the complex type now return
  NotImplemented rather than raising a TypeError when comparing with an
  incompatible type; this allows user-defined classes to implement their own
  comparisons with complex.

- Issue #3137: Don't ignore errors at startup, especially a keyboard interrupt
  (SIGINT). If an error occurs while importing the site module, the error is
  printed and Python exits. Initialize the GIL before importing the site module.

- Issue #7173: Generator finalization could invalidate sys.exc_info().

- Issue #7544: Preallocate thread memory before creating the thread to avoid a
  fatal error in low memory condition.

- Issue #7820: The parser tokenizer restores all bytes in the right if the BOM
  check fails.

- Handle errors from looking up __prepare__ correctly.

- Issue #5939: Add additional runtime checking to ensure a valid capsule in
  Modules/_ctypes/callproc.c.

- Issue #7309: Fix unchecked attribute access when converting
  UnicodeEncodeError, UnicodeDecodeError, and UnicodeTranslateError to strings.

- Issue #6902: Fix problem with built-in types format incorrectly with 0
  padding.

- Issue #7988: Fix default alignment to be right aligned for complex.__format__.
  Now it matches other numeric types.

- Issue #5988: Remove deprecated functions PyOS_ascii_formatd,
  PyOS_ascii_strtod, and PyOS_ascii_atof.  Use PyOS_double_to_string and
  PyOS_string_to_double instead.  See issue #5835 for the original deprecations.

- Issue #7385: Fix a crash in `MemoryView_FromObject` when `PyObject_GetBuffer`
  fails.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7788: Fix an interpreter crash produced by deleting a list slice with
  very large step value.

- Issue #7766: Change sys.getwindowsversion() return value to a named tuple and
  add the additional members returned in an OSVERSIONINFOEX structure.  The new
  members are service_pack_major, service_pack_minor, suite_mask, and
  product_type.

- Issue #7561: Operations on empty bytearrays (such as `int(bytearray())`) could
  crash in many places because of the PyByteArray_AS_STRING() macro returning
  NULL.  The macro now returns a statically allocated empty string instead.

- Issue #6690: Optimize the bytecode for expressions such as `x in {1, 2, 3}`,
  where the right hand operand is a set of constants, by turning the set into a
  frozenset and pre-building it as a constant.  The comparison operation is made
  against the constant instead of building a new set each time it is executed (a
  similar optimization already existed which turned a list of constants into a
  pre-built tuple).  Patch and additional tests by Dave Malcolm.

- Issue #7622: Improve the split(), rsplit(), splitlines() and replace() methods
  of bytes, bytearray and unicode objects by using a common implementation based
  on stringlib's fast search.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7632: Fix various str -> float conversion bugs present in 2.7 alpha 2,
  including: (1) a serious 'wrong output' bug that could occur for long (> 40
  digit) input strings, (2) a crash in dtoa.c that occurred in debug builds when
  parsing certain long numeric strings corresponding to subnormal values, (3) a
  memory leak for some values large enough to cause overflow, and (4) a number
  of flaws that could lead to incorrectly rounded results.

- The __complex__ method is now looked up on the class of instances to make it
  consistent with other special methods.

- Issue #7462: Implement the stringlib fast search algorithm for the `rfind`,
  `rindex`, `rsplit` and `rpartition` methods.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7604: Deleting an unset slotted attribute did not raise an
  AttributeError.

- Issue #7534: Fix handling of IEEE specials (infinities, nans, negative zero)
  in ** operator.  The behaviour now conforms to that described in C99 Annex F.

- Issue #1811: improve accuracy and cross-platform consistency for true division
  of integers: the result of a/b is now correctly rounded for ints a and b (at
  least on IEEE 754 platforms), and in particular does not depend on the
  internal representation of an int.

- Issue #6834: replace the implementation for the 'python' and 'pythonw'
  executables on OSX.

  These executables now work properly with the arch(1) command: ``arch -ppc
  python`` will start a universal binary version of python in PPC mode (unlike
  previous releases).

- Issue #7466: Segmentation fault when the garbage collector is called in the
  middle of populating a tuple.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7419: setlocale() could crash the interpreter on Windows when called
  with invalid values.

- Issue #6077: On Windows, files opened with tempfile.TemporaryFile in "wt+"
  mode would appear truncated on the first '0x1a' byte (aka. Ctrl+Z).

- Issue #7085: Fix crash when importing some extensions in a thread on MacOSX
  10.6.

- Issue #1757126: Fix the cyrillic-asian alias for the ptcp154 encoding.

- Issue #6970: Remove redundant calls when comparing objects that don't
  implement the relevant rich comparison methods.

- Issue #7298: Fixes for range and reversed(range(...)).  Iteration over
  range(a, b, c) incorrectly gave an empty iterator when a, b and c fit in C
  long but the length of the range did not.  Also fix several cases where
  reversed(range(a, b, c)) gave wrong results, and fix a refleak for
  reversed(range(a, b, c)) with large arguments.

- Issue #7244: itertools.izip_longest() no longer ignores exceptions raised
  during the formation of an output tuple.

- Issue #3297: On wide unicode builds, do not split unicode characters into
  surrogates.

- Remove length limitation when constructing a complex number from a string.

- Issue #1087418: Boost performance of bitwise operations for longs.

- Support for AtheOS has been completely removed from the code base. It was
  disabled since Python 3.0.

- Support for several legacy threading libraries has been disabled. These
  libraries are: Mach C threads, SunOS LWP, GNU pth, Irix threads. Support code
  will be entirely removed in 3.3.

- Support for OSF* has been disabled. If nobody stands up, support will be
  removed in 3.3. See <http://bugs.python.org/issue8606>.

- Peephole constant folding had missed UNARY_POSITIVE.

  fixes the problem of some exceptions being thrown at shutdown when the
  interpreter is killed. Patch by Adam Olsen.

- Issue #7147: Remove support for compiling Python without complex number
  support.

- Issue #7120: logging: Removed import of multiprocessing which is causing crash
  in GAE.

- Issue #1754094: Improve the stack depth calculation in the compiler.  There
  should be no other effect than a small decrease in memory use.  Patch by
  Christopher Tur Lesniewski-Laas.

- Issue #7065: Fix a crash in bytes.maketrans and bytearray.maketrans when using
  byte values greater than 127.  Patch by Derk Drukker.

- Issue #1571184: The Unicode database contains properties for more characters.
  The tables for code points representing numeric values, white spaces or line
  breaks are now generated from the official Unicode Character Database files,
  and include information from the Unihan.txt file.

- Issue #7019: Raise ValueError when unmarshalling bad long data, instead of
  producing internally inconsistent Python longs.

- Issue #6990: Fix threading.local subclasses leaving old state around after a
  reference cycle GC which could be recycled by new locals.

  the .py file to the .pyc file if it is set.

- Issue #1616979: Added the cp720 (Arabic DOS) encoding.

- Issue #6428: Since Python 3.0, the __bool__ method must return a bool object,
  and not an int.  Fix the corresponding error message, and the documentation.

- The deprecated PyCObject has been removed.

- Issue #6347: Include inttypes.h as well as stdint.h in pyport.h.  This fixes a
  build failure on HP-UX: int32_t and uint32_t are defined in inttypes.h instead
  of stdint.h on that platform.

- Issue #6373: Fixed a SystemError when encoding with the latin-1 codec and the
  'surrogateescape' error handler, a string which contains unpaired surrogates.

- Issue #4856: Remove checks for win NT.

- Issue #6687: PyBytes_FromObject() no longer accepts an integer as its argument
  to construct a null-initialized bytes object.

- Issue #1023290: Add from_bytes() and to_bytes() methods to integers.  These
  methods allow the conversion of integers to bytes, and vice-versa.

- Issue #7382: Fix bug in bytes.__getnewargs__ that prevented bytes instances
  from being copied with copy.copy(), and bytes subclasses from being pickled
  properly.

- Code objects now support weak references.

- Issue #7072: isspace(0xa0) is true on Mac OS X.

- Issue #8084: PEP 370 now conforms to system conventions for framework builds
  on MacOS X. That is, "python setup.py install --user" will install into
  "~/Library/Python/2.7" instead of "~/.local".

C-API
-----

- Issue #2443: A new macro, `Py_VA_COPY`, copies the state of the
  variable argument list.  `Py_VA_COPY` is equivalent to C99
  `va_copy`, but available on all python platforms.

- PySlice_GetIndicesEx now clips the step to [-PY_SSIZE_T_MAX, PY_SSIZE_T_MAX]
  instead of [-PY_SSIZE_T_MAX-1, PY_SSIZE_T_MAX].  This makes it safe to do
  "step = -step" when reversing a slice.

- Issue #5753: A new C API function, `PySys_SetArgvEx`, allows embedders of the
  interpreter to set sys.argv without also modifying sys.path.  This helps fix
  `CVE-2008-5983
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5983>`_.

- Add PyArg_ValidateKeywordArguments, which checks if all keyword arguments are
  strings in an efficient manner.

- Issue #8276: PyEval_CallObject() is now only available in macro form.  The
  function declaration, which was kept for backwards compatibility reasons, is
  now removed (the macro was introduced in 1997!).

- Issue #7767: New function PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow added, analogous to
  PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow.

- Make PyUnicode_CompareWithASCIIString return not equal if the Python string
  has '\0' at the end.

- Issue #5080: The argument parsing functions PyArg_ParseTuple,
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords, PyArg_VaParse, PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords and
  PyArg_Parse now raise a DeprecationWarning for float arguments passed with the
  'L' format code.  This will become a TypeError in a future version of Python,
  to match the behaviour of the other integer format codes.

- Issue #7033: Function ``PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc()`` added.

- Issue #7414: 'C' code wasn't being skipped properly (for keyword arguments) in
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords.

  PyErr_Format, on machines with HAVE_LONG_LONG defined.

- Issue #6151: Made PyDescr_COMMON conform to standard C (like PyObject_HEAD in
  PEP 3123).  The PyDescr_TYPE and PyDescr_NAME macros should be should used for
  accessing the d_type and d_name members of structures using PyDescr_COMMON.

- Issue #6405: Remove duplicate type declarations in descrobject.h.

- The code flags for old __future__ features are now available again.

- Issue #5954: Add a PyFrame_GetLineNumber() function to replace most uses of
  PyCode_Addr2Line().

- Issue #5959: Add a PyCode_NewEmpty() function to create a new empty code
  object at a specified file, function, and line number.

- Issue #1419652: Change the first argument to PyImport_AppendInittab() to
  ``const char *`` as the string is stored beyond the call.

- Issue #2422: When compiled with the ``--with-valgrind`` option, the pymalloc
  allocator will be automatically disabled when running under Valgrind.  This
  gives improved memory leak detection when running under Valgrind, while taking
  advantage of pymalloc at other times.

Library
-------

- In pdb, when Ctrl-C is entered while defining commands for a breakpoint, the
  old commands are restored.

- For traceback debugging, the pdb listing now also shows the locations where
  the exception was originally (re)raised, if it differs from the last line
  executed (e.g. in case of finally clauses).

- The pdb command "source" has been added.  It displays the source code for a
  given object, if possible.

- The pdb command "longlist" has been added.  It displays the whole source code
  for the current function.

- Issue #1503502: Make pdb.Pdb easier to subclass by putting message and error
  output into methods.

- Issue #809887: Make the output of pdb's breakpoint deletions more consistent;
  emit a message when a breakpoint is enabled or disabled.

  source file to be debugged is in a non-builtin encoding.

- Issue #8048: Prevent doctests from failing when sys.displayhook has been
  reassigned.

- Issue #8015: In pdb, do not crash when an empty line is entered as a
  breakpoint command.

- In pdb, allow giving a line number to the "until" command.

- Issue #1437051: For pdb, allow "continue" and related commands in .pdbrc
  files.  Also, add a command-line option "-c" that runs a command as if given
  in .pdbrc.

- Issue #4179: In pdb, allow "list ." as a command to return to the currently
  debugged line.

- The default size of the re module's compiled regular expression cache has been
  increased from 100 to 500 and the cache replacement policy has changed from
  simply clearing the entire cache on overflow to forgetting the least recently
  used cached compiled regular expressions.  This is a performance win for
  applications that use a lot of regular expressions and limits the impact of
  the performance hit anytime the cache is exceeded.

- Issue #7113: Speed up loading in configparser. Patch by Łukasz Langa.

- Issue #9032: XML-RPC client retries the request on EPIPE error.  The EPIPE
  error occurs when the server closes the socket and the client sends a big
  XML-RPC request.

  getopt doesn't accept a value (eg. --help= is rejected if getopt uses
  ['help='] long options).

- Issue #7989: Added pure python implementation of the `datetime` module.  The C
  module is renamed to `_datetime` and if available, overrides all classes
  defined in datetime with fast C impementation.  Python implementation is based
  on the original python prototype for the datetime module by Tim Peters with
  minor modifications by the PyPy project.  The test suite now tests `datetime`
  module with and without `_datetime` acceleration using the same test cases.

  giving the number of frames to go.

- Issue #9018: os.path.normcase() now raises a TypeError if the argument is not
  ``str`` or ``bytes``.

- Issue #9075: In the ssl module, remove the setting of a ``debug`` flag on an
  OpenSSL structure.

- Issue #8682: The ssl module now temporary increments the reference count of a
  socket object got through ``PyWeakref_GetObject``, so as to avoid possible
  deallocation while the object is still being used.

- Issue #1368368: FancyURLOpener class changed to throw an Exception on wrong
  password instead of presenting an interactive prompt.  Older behavior can be
  obtained by passing retry=True to http_error_xxx methods of FancyURLOpener.

  value to bytes instead of str (as done for c_char and c_char_p).

- Issue #8188: Comparisons between Decimal and Fraction objects are now
  permitted, returning a result based on the exact numerical values of the
  operands.  This builds on issue #2531, which allowed Decimal-to-float
  comparisons; all comparisons involving numeric types (bool, int, float,
  complex, Decimal, Fraction) should now act as expected.

  Thomas Jollans.

- Issue #8899: time.struct_time now has class and attribute docstrings.

- Issue #6470: Drop UNC prefix in FixTk.

  Context.clamp and make it public.  This is useful in creating contexts that
  correspond to the decimal interchange formats specified in IEEE 754.

- Issue #6268: Fix seek() method of codecs.open(), don't read or write the BOM
  twice after seek(0). Fix also reset() method of codecs, UTF-16, UTF-32 and

- Issue #8571: Fix an internal error when compressing or decompressing a chunk
  larger than 1GB with the zlib module's compressor and decompressor objects.

- Issue #8603: Support bytes environmental variables on Unix: Add os.environb
  mapping and os.getenvb() function. os.unsetenv() encodes str argument to the
  file system encoding with the surrogateescape error handler (instead of
  utf8/strict) and accepts bytes. posix.environ keys and values are now bytes.

- Issue #8573: asyncore _strerror() function might throw ValueError.

- Issue #8483: asyncore.dispatcher's __getattr__ method produced confusing error
  messages when accessing undefined class attributes because of the cheap
  inheritance with the underlying socket object.  The cheap inheritance has been
  deprecated.

- Issue #4265: shutil.copyfile() was leaking file descriptors when disk fills.
  Patch by Tres Seaver.

- Issue #8390: tarfile uses surrogateescape as the default error handler
  (instead of replace in read mode or strict in write mode).

- Issue #7755: Use an unencumbered audio file for tests.

- Issue #8621: uuid.uuid4() returned the same sequence of values in the parent
  and any children created using ``os.fork`` on MacOS X 10.6.

- Issue #8567: Fix precedence of signals in Decimal module: when a Decimal
  operation raises multiple signals and more than one of those signals is
  trapped, the specification determines the order in which the signals should be
  handled.  In many cases this order wasn't being followed, leading to the wrong
  Python exception being raised.

  started running.  This also fixes the occasional freezes witnessed in
  test_httpservers.

- Issue #8524: When creating an SSL socket, the timeout value of the original
  socket wasn't retained (instead, a socket with a positive timeout would be
  turned into a non-blocking SSL socket).

  indefinitely if the other end didn't respond.

- The do_handshake() method of SSL objects now adjusts the blocking mode of the
  SSL structure if necessary (as other methods already do).

- Issue #8451: Syslog module now uses basename(sys.argv[0]) instead of the
  string "python" as the *ident*.  openlog() arguments are all optional and
  keywords.

- Issue #8108: Fix the unwrap() method of SSL objects when the socket has a
  non-infinite timeout.  Also make that method friendlier with applications
  wanting to continue using the socket in clear-text mode, by disabling
  OpenSSL's internal readahead.  Thanks to Darryl Miles for guidance.

- Issue #8496: make mailcap.lookup() always return a list, rather than an
  iterator.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

  Locke and Hans Ulrich Niedermann.

- Issue #5277: Fix quote counting when parsing RFC 2231 encoded parameters.

- Issue #7316: The acquire() method of lock objects in the :mod:`threading`
  module now takes an optional timeout argument in seconds.  Timeout support
  relies on the system threading library, so as to avoid a semi-busy wait loop.

- Issue #8383: pickle and pickletools use surrogatepass error handler when
  encoding unicode as utf8 to support lone surrogates and stay compatible with
  Python 2.x and 3.x.

- Issue #7585: difflib context and unified diffs now place a tab between
  filename and date, conforming to the 'standards' they were originally designed
  to follow.  This improves compatibility with patch tools.

- Issue #8257: The Decimal construct now accepts a float instance directly,
  converting that float to a Decimal of equal value:

     >>> Decimal(1.1)
     Decimal('1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625')

- Issue #8294: The Fraction constructor now accepts Decimal and float instances
  directly.

- Issue #7279: Comparisons involving a Decimal signaling NaN now signal
  InvalidOperation instead of returning False.  (Comparisons involving a quiet
  NaN are unchanged.)  Also, Decimal quiet NaNs are now hashable; Decimal
  signaling NaNs remain unhashable.

- Issue #2531: Comparison operations between floats and Decimal instances now
  return a result based on the numeric values of the operands; previously they
  returned an arbitrary result based on the relative ordering of id(float) and
  id(Decimal).  See also issue #8188, which adds Decimal-to-Fraction
  comparisons.

- Added a subtract() method to collections.Counter().

- Issue #8233: When run as a script, py_compile.py optionally takes a single
  argument `-` which tells it to read files to compile from stdin.  Each line is
  read on demand and the named file is compiled immediately.  (Original patch by
  Piotr Ożarowski).

- Backwards incompatible change: Unicode codepoints line tabulation (0x0B) and
  form feed (0x0C) are now considered linebreaks, as specified in Unicode
  Standard Annex #14.  See issue #7643.  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/

- Comparisons using one of <, <=, >, >= between a complex instance and a
  Fractions instance now raise TypeError instead of returning True/False.  This
  makes Fraction <=> complex comparisons consistent with int <=> complex, float
  <=> complex, and complex <=> complex comparisons.

- Issue #8139: ossaudiodev didn't initialize its types properly, therefore some
  methods (such as oss_mixer_device.fileno()) were not available.  Initial patch
  by Bertrand Janin.

- Issue #8205: Remove the "Modules" directory from sys.path when Python is
  running from the build directory (POSIX only).

- Issue #7512: shutil.copystat() could raise an OSError when the filesystem
  didn't support chflags() (for example ZFS under FreeBSD).  The error is now
  silenced.

- Issue #7860: platform.uname now reports the correct 'machine' type when Python
  is running in WOW64 mode on 64 bit Windows.

- Issue #3890, #8222: Fix recv() and recv_into() on non-blocking SSL sockets.
  Also, enable the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag on SSL sockets, so that blocking
  reads and writes are always retried by OpenSSL itself.

- Issue #7356: ctypes.util: Make parsing of ldconfig output independent of the
  locale.

- The internals of the subprocess module on POSIX systems have been replaced by
  an extension module (_posixsubprocess) so that the fork()+exec() can be done
  safely without the possibility of deadlock in multithreaded applications.

- subprocess.Popen now has restore_signals and start_new_session features.  The
  default of restore_signals=True is a new behavior compared to earlier Python
  versions.  This means that signals such as SIGPIPE are not ignored by default
  in subprocesses launched by Python (Issue #1652).

- Issue #6472: The xml.etree package is updated to ElementTree 1.3.  The
  cElementTree module is updated too.

- Issue #7774: Set sys.executable to an empty string if argv[0] has been set to
  an non existent program name and Python is unable to retrieve the real program
  name.

- Issue #7880: Fix sysconfig when the python executable is a symbolic link.

- Issue #6509: fix re.sub to work properly when the pattern, the string, and the
  replacement were all bytes.  Patch by Antoine Pitrou.

  bytecode file when it was less then 8 bytes.

- Issue #7633: In the decimal module, Context class methods (with the exception
  of canonical and is_canonical) now accept instances of int and long wherever a
  Decimal instance is accepted, and implicitly convert that argument to Decimal.
  Previously only some arguments were converted.

- Issue #7835: shelve should no longer produce mysterious warnings during
  interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #2746: Don't escape ampersands and angle brackets ("&", "<", ">") in XML
  processing instructions and comments.  These raw characters are allowed by the
  XML specification, and are necessary when outputting e.g.  PHP code in a
  processing instruction.  Patch by Neil Muller.

- Issue #6233: ElementTree failed converting unicode characters to XML entities
  when they could't be represented in the requested output encoding.  Patch by

  specified, rather than fall through to AF_PACKET (in the `socket` module).
  Also, raise ValueError rather than TypeError when an unknown TIPC address type
  is specified.  Patch by Brian Curtin.

- Issue #6939: Fix file I/O objects in the `io` module to keep the original file
  position when calling `truncate()`.  It would previously change the file
  position to the given argument, which goes against the tradition of
  ftruncate() and other truncation APIs.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #7610: Reworked implementation of the internal
  :class:`zipfile.ZipExtFile` class used to represent files stored inside an
  archive.  The new implementation is significantly faster and can be wrapped in
  a :class:`io.BufferedReader` object for more speedups.  It also solves an
  issue where interleaved calls to `read()` and `readline()` give wrong results.
  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Issue #6963: Added "maxtasksperchild" argument to multiprocessing.Pool,
  allowing for a maximum number of tasks within the pool to be completed by the

  Distutils upload command to avoid an error when PyPI reads it.  This occurs on
  long passwords. Initial patch by JP St. Pierre.

- Issue #7231: urllib2 cannot handle https with proxy requiring auth.  Patch by
  Tatsuhiro Tsujikawa.

- Issue #4757: `zlib.compress` and other methods in the zlib module now raise a
  TypeError when given an `str` object (rather than a `bytes`-like object).
  Patch by Victor Stinner and Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7349: Make methods of file objects in the io module accept None as an
  argument where file-like objects (ie StringIO and BytesIO) accept them to mean
  the same as passing no argument.

  access to the initgroups(3) C library call on Unix systems which implement it.
  Patch by Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #7408: Fixed distutils.tests.sdist so it doesn't check for group
  ownership when the group is not forced, because the group may be different
  from the user's group and inherit from its container when the test is run.

- Issue #4486: When an exception has an explicit cause, do not print its
  implicit context too.  This affects the `traceback` module as well as built-in

- Issue #4969: The mimetypes module now reads the MIME database from the
  registry under Windows.  Patch by Gabriel Genellina.

- Issue #6816: runpy now provides a run_path function that allows Python code to
  execute file paths that refer to source or compiled Python files as well as
  zipfiles, directories and other valid sys.path entries that contain a
  __main__.py file.  This allows applications that run other Python scripts to
  support the same flexibility as the CPython command line itself.

- Issue #7318: multiprocessing now uses a timeout when it fails to establish a
  connection with another process, rather than looping endlessly.  The default
  timeout is 20 seconds, which should be amply sufficient for local connections.

- Issue #7197: Allow unittest.TextTestRunner objects to be pickled and
  unpickled.  This fixes crashes under Windows when trying to run
  test_multiprocessing in verbose mode.

- Issue #7893: ``unittest.TextTestResult`` is made public and a ``resultclass``
  argument added to the TextTestRunner constructor allowing a different result
  class to be used without having to subclass.

- Issue #7588: ``unittest.TextTestResult.getDescription`` now includes the test
  name in failure reports even if the test has a docstring.

- Issue #3001: Add a C implementation of recursive locks which is used by
  default when instantiating a `threading.RLock` object. This makes recursive
  locks as fast as regular non-recursive locks (previously, they were slower by
  10x to 15x).

- Issue #7282: Fix a memory leak when an RLock was used in a thread other than
  those started through `threading.Thread` (for example, using
  `_thread.start_new_thread()`).

- Issue #7187: Importlib would not silence the IOError raised when trying to
  write new bytecode when it was made read-only.

- Issue #7264: Fix a possible deadlock when deallocating thread-local objects
  which are part of a reference cycle.

- Issue #7211: Allow 64-bit values for the `ident` and `data` fields of kevent
  objects on 64-bit systems.  Patch by Michael Broghton.

- Issue #6896: mailbox.Maildir now invalidates its internal cache each time a
  modification is done through it.  This fixes inconsistencies and test failures
  on systems with slightly bogus mtime behaviour.

- Issue #7246 & Issue #7208: getpass now properly flushes input before reading
  from stdin so that existing input does not confuse it and lead to incorrect
  entry or an IOError.  It also properly flushes it afterwards to avoid the
  terminal echoing the input afterwards on OSes such as Solaris.

- Issue #7233: Fix a number of two-argument Decimal methods to make sure that
  they accept an int or long as the second argument.  Also fix buggy handling of
  large arguments (those with coefficient longer than the current precision) in

- Issue #6850: Fix bug in Decimal._parse_format_specifier for formats with no
  type specifier.

- Issue #6239: ctypes.c_char_p return value must return bytes.

- Issue #6838: Use a list to accumulate the value instead of repeatedly
  concatenating strings in http.client's HTTPResponse._read_chunked providing a
  significant speed increase when downloading large files servend with a
  Transfer-Encoding of 'chunked'.

- Trying to import a submodule from a module that is not a package, ImportError
  should be raised, not AttributeError.

- When the globals past to importlib.__import__() has __package__ set to None,
  fall back to computing what __package__ should be instead of giving up.

- Raise a TypeError when the name of a module to be imported for
  importlib.__import__ is not a string (was raising an AttributeError before).

  working through proxy.  Original patch by Christopher Li, changes made by
  Senthil Kumaran.

- Add importlib.abc.ExecutionLoader to represent the PEP 302 protocol for
  loaders that allow for modules to be executed. Both importlib.abc.PyLoader and
  PyPycLoader inherit from this class and provide implementations in relation to
  other methods required by the ABCs.

- importlib.abc.PyLoader did not inherit from importlib.abc.ResourceLoader like
  the documentation said it did even though the code in PyLoader relied on the
  abstract method required by ResourceLoader.

  for tracing methods.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #9959: Tweak formula used for computing math.log of an integer,
  making it marginally more accurate for exact powers of 2.

- Issue #9422: Fix memory leak when re-initializing a struct.Struct object.

- Issue #7900: The getgroups(2) system call on MacOSX behaves rather oddly
  compared to other unix systems. In particular, os.getgroups() does not reflect
  any changes made using os.setgroups() but basicly always returns the same
  information as the id command. os.getgroups() can now return more than 16
  groups on MacOSX.

- Issue #6095: Make directory argument to os.listdir optional.

- Issue #9277: Fix bug in struct.pack for bools in standard mode (e.g.,
  struct.pack('>?')): if conversion to bool raised an exception then that
  exception wasn't properly propagated on machines where char is unsigned.

- Issue #5180: Fixed a bug that prevented loading 2.x pickles in 3.x python when
  they contain instances of old-style classes.

- Issue #9165: Add new functions math.isfinite and cmath.isfinite, to accompany
  existing isinf and isnan functions.

- Issue #1578269: Implement os.symlink for Windows 6.0+.  Patch by Jason
  R. Coombs.

- In struct.pack, correctly propogate exceptions from computing the truth of an
  object in the '?' format.

- Issue #9000: datetime.timezone objects now have eval-friendly repr.

- In the math module, correctly lookup __trunc__, __ceil__, and __floor__ as
  special methods.

- Issue #9005: Prevent utctimetuple() from producing year 0 or year 10,000.
  Prior to this change, timezone adjustment in utctimetuple() could produce
  tm_year value of 0 or 10,000.  Now an OverflowError is raised in these edge
  cases.

- Issue #6641: The ``datetime.strptime`` method now supports the ``%z``
  directive.  When the ``%z`` directive is present in the format string, an
  aware ``datetime`` object is returned with ``tzinfo`` bound to a
  ``datetime.timezone`` instance constructed from the parsed offset.  If both
  ``%z`` and ``%Z`` are present, the data in ``%Z`` field is used for timezone
  name, but ``%Z`` data without ``%z`` is discarded.

- Issue #5094: The ``datetime`` module now has a simple concrete class
  implementing ``datetime.tzinfo`` interface.  Instances of the new class,
  ``datetime.timezone``, return fixed name and UTC offset from their
  ``tzname(dt)`` and ``utcoffset(dt)`` methods.  The ``dst(dt)`` method always
  returns ``None``.  A class attribute, ``utc`` contains an instance
  representing the UTC timezone.  Original patch by Rafe Kaplan.

- Issue #8973: Add __all__ to struct module; this ensures that help(struct)
  includes documentation for the struct.Struct class.

- Issue #3129: Trailing digits in struct format string are no longer ignored.
  For example, "1" or "ilib123" are now invalid formats and cause
  ``struct.error`` to be raised.  Patch by Caleb Deveraux.

- Issue #7384: If the system readline library is linked against ncurses, the
  curses module must be linked against ncurses as well. Otherwise it is not safe
  to load both the readline and curses modules in an application.

- Issue #2810: Fix cases where the Windows registry API returns ERROR_MORE_DATA,
  requiring a re-try in order to get the complete result.

- Issue #8692: Optimize math.factorial: replace the previous naive algorithm
  with an improved 'binary-split' algorithm that uses fewer multiplications and
  allows many of the multiplications to be performed using plain C integer
  arithmetic instead of PyLong arithmetic.  Also uses a lookup table for small
  arguments.

- Issue #8674: Fixed a number of incorrect or undefined-behaviour-inducing
  overflow checks in the audioop module.

- Issue #8644: The accuracy of td.total_seconds() has been improved (by
  calculating with integer arithmetic instead of float arithmetic internally):
  the result is now always correctly rounded, and is equivalent to ``td /
  timedelta(seconds=1)``.

- Issue #2706: Allow division of a timedelta by another timedelta: timedelta /
  timedelta, timedelta % timedelta, timedelta // timedelta and divmod(timedelta,
  timedelta) are all supported.

- Issue #8314: Fix unsigned long long bug in libffi on Sparc v8.

- Issue #8300: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with any
  integer format code, struct.pack first attempts to convert the non-integer
  using its __index__ method.  If that method is non-existent or raises
  TypeError it goes on to try the __int__ method, as described below.

- Issue #8142: Update libffi to the 3.0.9 release.

- Issue #6949: Allow the _dbm extension to be built with db 4.8.x.

- Issue #6544: Fix a reference leak in the kqueue implementation's error
  handling.

  readline emulation on OSX 10.5 or later.

- Issue #6848: Fix curses module build failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fix a segfault that could be triggered by expat with specially formed input.

- Issue #6561: '\d' in a regex now matches only characters with Unicode category
  'Nd' (Number, Decimal Digit).  Previously it also matched characters with
  category 'No'.

- Issue #4509: Array objects are no longer modified after an operation failing
  due to the resize restriction in-place when the object has exported buffers.

- Issue #2389: Array objects are now pickled in a portable manner.

- Expat: Fix DoS via XML document with malformed UTF-8 sequences
  (CVE_2009_3560).

- Issue #7242: On Solaris 9 and earlier calling os.fork() from within a thread
  could raise an incorrect RuntimeError about not holding the import lock.  The
  import lock is now reinitialized after fork.

- Issue #7999: os.setreuid() and os.setregid() would refuse to accept a -1
  parameter on some platforms such as OS X.

- Build the ossaudio extension on GNU/kFreeBSD.

- Issue #7347: winreg: Add CreateKeyEx and DeleteKeyEx, as well as fix a bug in

Tests
-----

- Issue #9251: test_threaded_import didn't fail when run through regrtest if the
  import lock was disabled.

- Issue #8605: Skip test_gdb if Python is compiled with optimizations.

- Issue #7449: Skip test_socketserver if threading support is disabled.

- Issue #8672: Add a zlib test ensuring that an incomplete stream can be handled
  by a decompressor object without errors (it returns incomplete uncompressed
  data).

- Issue #8533: regrtest uses backslashreplace error handler for stdout to avoid
  UnicodeEncodeError (write non-ASCII character to stdout using ASCII encoding).

- Issue #8576: Remove use of find_unused_port() in test_smtplib and
  test_multiprocessing.  Patch by Paul Moore.

- Issue #7449: Fix many tests to support Python compiled without thread
  support. Patches written by Jerry Seutter.

- Issue #8108: test_ftplib's non-blocking SSL server now has proper handling of
  SSL shutdowns.

- Issues #8279, #8330, #8437, #8480, #8495: Fix test_gdb failures, patch written
  by Dave Malcolm.

- Issue #3864: Skip three test_signal tests on freebsd6 because they fail if any
  thread was previously started, most likely due to a platform bug.

- Issue #8193: Fix test_zlib failure with zlib 1.2.4.

- Issue #8248: Add some tests for the bool type.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

- Issue #8263: Now regrtest.py will report a failure if it receives a
  KeyboardInterrupt (SIGINT).

- Issue #8180 and #8207: Fix test_pep277 on OS X and add more tests for special
  Unicode normalization cases.

- Issue #7783: test.support.open_urlresource invalidates the outdated files from
  the local cache.

- Issue #7849: Now the utility ``check_warnings`` verifies if the warnings are
  effectively raised.

- The four path modules (genericpath, macpath, ntpath, posixpath) share a common
  TestCase for some tests: test_genericpath.CommonTest.

- Print platform information when running the whole test suite, or using the
  --verbose flag.

- Issue #767675: enable test_pep277 on POSIX platforms with Unicode-friendly
  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #6292: for the moment at least, the test suite runs cleanly if python is
  run with the -OO flag.  Tests requiring docstrings are skipped.

- Issue #7712: test.support gained a new `temp_cwd` context manager which is now
  also used by regrtest to run all the tests in a temporary directory.  The
  original CWD is saved in `support.SAVEDCWD`.  Thanks to Florent Xicluna who
  helped with the patch.

- Issue #7924: Fix an intermittent 'XXX undetected error' failure in test_capi
  (only seen so far on platforms where the curses module wasn't built), due to
  an uncleared exception.

- Issue #7728: test_timeout was changed to use support.bind_port instead of a
  hard coded port.

- Issue #7376: Instead of running a self-test (which was failing) when called
  with no arguments, doctest.py now gives a usage message.

- Issue #7396: fix regrtest -s, which was broken by the -j enhancement.

- Issue #7498: test_multiprocessing now uses test.support.find_unused_port
  instead of a hardcoded port number in test_rapid_restart.

- Issue #7431: Use TESTFN in test_linecache instead of trying to create a file
  in the Lib/test directory, which might be read-only for the user running the
  tests.

- Issue #7324: Add a sanity check to regrtest argument parsing to catch the case
  of an option with no handler.

- Issue #7312: Add a -F flag to run the selected tests in a loop until a test
  fails.  Can be combined with -j.

- Issue #6551: test_zipimport could import and then destroy some modules of the
  encodings package, which would make other tests fail further down the road
  because the internally cached encoders and decoders would point to empty
  global variables.

- Issue #7295: Do not use a hardcoded file name in test_tarfile.

- Issue #7270: Add some dedicated unit tests for multi-thread synchronization
  primitives such as Lock, RLock, Condition, Event and Semaphore.

- Issue #7248 (part 2): Use a unique temporary directory for importlib source
  tests instead of tempfile.tempdir. This prevents the tests from sharing state
  between concurrent executions on the same system.

- Issue #7248: In importlib.test.source.util a try/finally block did not make
  sure that some referenced objects actually were created in the block before
  calling methods on the object.

- Issue #7222: Make thread "reaping" more reliable so that reference
  leak-chasing test runs give sensible results. The previous method of reaping
  threads could return successfully while some Thread objects were still
  referenced. This also introduces a new private function:
  :func:`_thread._count()`.

- Issue #7151: Fixed regrtest -j so that output to stderr from a test no longer
  runs the risk of causing the worker thread to fail.

- Issue #7055: test___all__ now greedily detects all modules which have an
  __all__ attribute, rather than using a hardcoded and incomplete list.

- Issue #7058: Added save/restore for things like sys.argv and cwd to
  runtest_inner in regrtest, with warnings if the called test modifies them, and
  a new section in the summary report at the end.

- Issue #7042: Fix test_signal (test_itimer_virtual) failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fixed tests in importlib.test.source.test_abc_loader that were masking the
  proper exceptions that should be raised for missing or improper code object
  bytecode.

- Removed importlib's custom test discovery code and switched to
  unittest.TestLoader.discover().

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #5464, #8974: Implement plural forms in msgfmt.py.

- iobench (a file I/O benchmark) and ccbench (a concurrency benchmark) were
  added to the `Tools/` directory.  They were previously living in the sandbox.

  are always None now.

- Issue #6137: The pickle module now translates module names when loading

What's New in Python 3.1 release candidate 1?
=============================================

*Release date: 2009-05-30*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #6097: Escape UTF-8 surrogates resulting from mbstocs conversion
  of the command line.

- Issue #6012: Add cleanup support to O& argument parsing.

- Issue #6089: Fixed str.format with certain invalid field specifiers
  that would raise SystemError.

- Issue #5982: staticmethod and classmethod now expose the wrapped
  function with __func__.

- Added support for multiple context managers in the same with-statement.
  Deprecated contextlib.nested() which is no longer needed.

- Issue #5829: complex("1e500") no longer raises OverflowError.  This
  makes it consistent with float("1e500") and interpretation of real
  and imaginary literals.

- Issue #3527: Removed Py_WIN_WIDE_FILENAMES which is not used any more.

- Issue #5994: the marshal module now has docstrings.

- Issue #5981: Fix three minor inf/nan issues in float.fromhex:
  (1) inf and nan strings with trailing whitespace were incorrectly
  rejected;  (2) parsing of strings representing infinities and nans
  was locale aware; and (3) the interpretation of fromhex('-nan')
  didn't match that of float('-nan').

Library
-------

- Issue #4859: Implement PEP 383 for pwd, spwd, and grp.

- smtplib 'login' and 'cram-md5' login are also fixed (see Issue #5259).

- Issue #6121: pydoc now ignores leading and trailing spaces in the
  argument to the 'help' function.

- Issue #6118: urllib.parse.quote_plus ignored the encoding and errors
  arguments for strings with a space in them.

- collections.namedtuple() was not working with the following field
  names:  cls, self, tuple, itemgetter, and property.

- In unittest, using a skipping decorator on a class is now equivalent to
  skipping every test on the class.  The ClassTestSuite class has been removed.

- Issue #6050: Don't fail extracting a directory from a zipfile if
  the directory already exists.

- Issue #1309352: fcntl now converts its third arguments to a C `long` rather
  than an int, which makes some operations possible under 64-bit Linux (e.g.
  DN_MULTISHOT with F_NOTIFY).

- Issue #5761: Add the name of the underlying file to the repr() of various
  IO objects.

- Issue #5259: smtplib plain auth login no longer gives a traceback.  Fix
  by Musashi Tamura, tests by Marcin Bachry.

- Issue #1983: Fix functions taking or returning a process identifier to use
  the dedicated C type ``pid_t`` instead of a C ``int``. Some platforms have
  a process identifier type wider than the standard C integer type.

- Issue #4066: smtplib.SMTP_SSL._get_socket now correctly returns the socket.
  Patch by Farhan Ahmad, test by Marcin Bachry.

- Issue #2116: Weak references and weak dictionaries now support copy()ing and
  deepcopy()ing.

- Issue #1655: Make imaplib IPv6-capable. Patch by Derek Morr.

- Issue #5918: Fix a crash in the parser module.

- Issue #1664: Make nntplib IPv6-capable. Patch by Derek Morr.

- Issue #5006: Better handling of unicode byte-order marks (BOM) in the io
  library. This means, for example, that opening an UTF-16 text file in
  append mode doesn't add a BOM at the end of the file if the file isn't
  empty.

- Issue #4050: inspect.findsource/getsource now raise an IOError if the 'source'
  file is a binary.  Patch by Brodie Rao, tests by Daniel Diniz.  This fix
  corrects a pydoc regression.

- Issue #5955: aifc's close method did not close the file it wrapped,
  now it does.  This also means getfp method now returns the real fp.

Installation
------------

- Issue #6047: fullinstall has been removed because Python 3's executable will
  now be known as python3.

- Lib/smtpd.py is no longer installed as a script.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #3061: Use wcsftime for time.strftime where available.

- Issue #4873: Fix resource leaks in error cases of pwd and grp.

- Issue #6093: Fix off-by-one error in locale.strxfrm.

- The _functools and _locale modules are now built into the libpython shared
  library instead of as extension modules.

Build
-----

- Issue #3585: Add pkg-config support. It creates a python-2.7.pc file
  and a python3.pc symlink in the $(LIBDIR)/pkgconfig directory. Patch by
  Clinton Roy.

Tests
-----

- Issue #5442: Tests for importlib were not properly skipping case-sensitivity
  tests on darwin even when the OS was installed on a case-sensitive
  filesystem. Also fixed tests that should not be run when
  sys.dont_write_bytecode is true.


What's New in Python 3.1 beta 1?
================================

*Release date: 2009-05-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #5914: Add new C API function PyOS_string_to_double, and
  deprecate PyOS_ascii_strtod and PyOS_ascii_atof.

- Issue #3382: float.__format__, complex.__format__, and %-formatting
  no longer map 'F' to 'f'. Because of issue #5859 (below), this only
  affects nan -> NAN and inf -> INF.

- Issue #5799: ntpath (ie, os.path on Windows) fully supports UNC pathnames
  in all operations, including splitdrive, split, etc.  splitunc() now issues
  a PendingDeprecation warning.

- Issue #5920: For float.__format__, change the behavior with the
  empty presentation type (that is, not one of 'e', 'f', 'g', or 'n')
  to be like 'g' but with at least one decimal point and with a
  default precision of 12. Previously, the behavior the same but with
  a default precision of 6.  This more closely matches str(), and
  reduces surprises when adding alignment flags to the empty
  presentation type. This also affects the new complex.__format__ in
  the same way.

- Implement PEP 383, Non-decodable Bytes in System Character Interfaces.

- Issue #5890: in subclasses of 'property' the __doc__ attribute was
  shadowed by classtype's, even if it was None.  property now
  inserts the __doc__ into the subclass instance __dict__.

- Issue #4426: The UTF-7 decoder was too strict and didn't accept some legal
  sequences. Patch by Nick Barnes and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #3672: Reject surrogates in utf-8 codec; add surrogatepass error handler.

- Issue #5883: In the io module, the BufferedIOBase and TextIOBase ABCs have
  received a new method, detach().  detach() disconnects the underlying stream
  from the buffer or text IO and returns it.

- Issue #5859: Remove switch from '%f' to '%g'-style formatting for
  floats with absolute value over 1e50.  Also remove length
  restrictions for float formatting: '%.67f' % 12.34 and '%.120e' %
  12.34 no longer raise an exception.

- Issue #1588: Add complex.__format__. For example,
  format(complex(1, 2./3), '.5') now produces a sensible result.

- Issue #5864: Fix empty format code formatting for floats so that it
  never gives more than the requested number of significant digits.

- Issue #5793: Rationalize isdigit / isalpha / tolower, etc. Includes
  new Py_ISDIGIT / Py_ISALPHA / Py_TOLOWER, etc. in pctypes.h.

- Issue #5835: Deprecate PyOS_ascii_formatd.

- Issue #4971: Fix titlecase for characters that are their own
  titlecase, but not their own uppercase.

- Issue #5283: Setting __class__ in __del__ caused a segfault.

- Issue #5816: complex(repr(z)) now recovers z exactly, even when
  z involves nans, infs or negative zeros.

- Issue #3166: Make int -> float conversions correctly rounded.

- Issue #1869 (and many duplicates): make round(x, n) correctly
  rounded for a float x, by using the decimal <-> binary conversions
  from Python/dtoa.c.  As a consequence, (e.g.) round(x, 2) now
  consistently agrees with format(x, '.2f').

- Issue #5787: object.__getattribute__(some_type, "__bases__") segfaulted on
  some builtin types.

- Issue #5772: format(1e100, '<') produces '1e+100', not '1.0e+100'.

- Issue #5515: str.format() type 'n' combined with commas and leading
  zeros no longer gives odd results with ints and floats.

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for
  floats.

- The str function switches to exponential notation at
  1e11, not 1e12.  This avoids printing 13 significant digits in
  situations where only 12 of them are correct.  Example problem
  value: str(1e11 + 0.5).  (This minor issue has existed in 2.x for a
  long time.)

- Issue #1580: On most platforms, use a 'short' float repr: for a
  finite float x, repr(x) now outputs a string based on the shortest
  sequence of decimal digits that rounds to x.  Previous behaviour was
  to output 17 significant digits and then strip trailing zeros.
  Another minor difference is that the new repr switches to
  exponential notation at 1e16 instead of the previous 1e17; this
  avoids misleading output in some cases.

  There's a new sys attribute sys.float_repr_style, which takes
  the value 'short' to indicate that we're using short float repr,
  and 'legacy' if the short float repr isn't available for one
  reason or another.

  The float repr change involves incorporating David Gay's 'perfect
  rounding' code into the Python core (it's in Python/dtoa.c).  As a
  secondary consequence, all string-to-float and float-to-string
  conversions (including all float formatting operations) will be
  correctly rounded on these platforms.

  See issue #1580 discussions for details of platforms for which
  this change does not apply.

- Issue #5759: float() didn't call __float__ on str subclasses.

- The string.maketrans() function is deprecated; there is a new static method
  maketrans() on the bytes and bytearray classes.  This removes confusion about
  the types string.maketrans() is supposed to work with, and mirrors the
  methods available on the str class.

- Issue #2170: refactored xml.dom.minidom.normalize, increasing both
  its clarity and its speed.

- Issue #1113244: Py_XINCREF, Py_DECREF, Py_XDECREF: Add ``do { ... } while (0)``
  to avoid compiler warnings.

- Issue #3739: The unicode-internal encoder now reports the number of characters
  consumed like any other encoder (instead of the number of bytes).

Installation
------------

- Issue #5756: Install idle and pydoc with a 3 suffix.

Library
-------

- Issue #8203: Fix IDLE Credits dialog: view_file() uses its encoding argument.

- Issue #5311: bdist_msi can now build packages that do not depend on a
  specific Python version.

- Issue #5150: IDLE's format menu now has an option to strip trailing
  whitespace.

- Issue #5940: distutils.command.build_clib.check_library_list was not doing
  the right type checkings anymore.

- Issue #4875: On win32, ctypes.util.find_library does no longer
  return directories.

- Issue #5142: Add the ability to skip modules while stepping to pdb.

- Issue #1309567: Fix linecache behavior of stripping subdirectories when
  looking for files given by a relative filename.

- Issue #5923: Update the ``turtle`` module to version 1.1, add two new
  turtle demos in Demo/turtle.

- Issue #5692: In :class:`zipfile.Zipfile`, fix wrong path calculation when
  extracting a file to the root directory.

- Issue #5913: os.listdir() should fail for empty path on windows.

- Issue #5084: unpickling now interns the attribute names of pickled objects,
  saving memory and avoiding growth in size of subsequent pickles. Proposal
  and original patch by Jake McGuire.

- The json module now works exclusively with str and not bytes.

- Issue #3959: The ipaddr module has been added to the standard library.
  Contributed by Google.

- Issue #3002: ``shutil.copyfile()`` and ``shutil.copytree()`` now raise an
  error when a named pipe is encountered, rather than blocking infinitely.

- Issue #5857: tokenize.tokenize() now returns named tuples.

- Issue #4305: ctypes should now build again on mipsel-linux-gnu

- Issue #1734234: Massively speedup ``unicodedata.normalize()`` when the
  string is already in normalized form, by performing a quick check beforehand.
  Original patch by Rauli Ruohonen.

- Issue #5853: calling a function of the mimetypes module from several threads
  at once could hit the recursion limit if the mimetypes database hadn't been
  initialized before.

- Issue #5854: Updated __all__ to include some missing names and remove some
  names which should not be exported.

- Issue #3102:  All global symbols that the _ctypes extension defines
  are now prefixed with 'Py' or '_ctypes'.

- Issue #5041: ctypes does now allow pickling wide character.

- Issue #5812: For the two-argument form of the Fraction constructor,
  Fraction(m, n), m and n are permitted to be arbitrary Rational
  instances.

- Issue #5812: Fraction('1e6') is valid: more generally, any string
  that's valid for float() is now valid for Fraction(), with the
  exception of strings representing NaNs and infinities.

- Issue #5734: BufferedRWPair was poorly tested and had several glaring
  bugs. Patch by Brian Quinlan.

- Issue #1161031: fix readwrite select flag handling: POLLPRI now
  results in a handle_expt_event call, not handle_read_event, and POLLERR
  and POLLNVAL now call handle_close, not handle_expt_event.  Also,
  dispatcher now has an 'ignore_log_types' attribute for suppressing
  log messages, which is set to 'warning' by default.

- Issue #2703: SimpleXMLRPCDispatcher.__init__: Provide default values for
  new arguments introduced in 2.5.

- Issue #5828 (Invalid behavior of unicode.lower): Fixed bogus logic in
  makeunicodedata.py and regenerated the Unicode database (This fixes

- Issue #5359: Readd the Berkeley DB detection code to allow _dbm be built
  using Berkeley DB.

Tests
-----

- Issue #5354: New test support function import_fresh_module() makes
  it easy to import both normal and optimised versions of modules.
  test_heapq and test_warnings have been adjusted to use it, tests for
  other modules with both C and Python implementations in the stdlib
  can be adjusted to use it over time.

- Issue #5837: Certain sequences of calls to set() and unset() for
  support.EnvironmentVarGuard objects restored the environment variables
  incorrectly on __exit__.

C-API
-----

- Issue #5630: A replacement PyCObject API, PyCapsule, has been added.


What's New in Python 3.1 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 2009-4-4*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for
  integers.

- Issue #5666: Py_BuildValue's 'c' code should create byte strings.

- Issue #5499: The 'c' code for argument parsing functions now only accepts a
  byte, and the 'C' code only accepts a unicode character.

- Fix a problem in PyErr_NormalizeException that leads to "undetected errors"
  when hitting the recursion limit under certain circumstances.

- Issue #1665206: Remove the last eager import in _warnings.c and make it lazy.

- Fix a segfault when running test_exceptions with coverage, caused by
  insufficient checks in accessors of Exception.__context__.

- Issue #5604: non-ASCII characters in module name passed to
  imp.find_module() were converted to UTF-8 while the path is
  converted to the default filesystem encoding, causing nonsense.

- Issue #5126: str.isprintable() returned False for space characters.

- Issue #4865: On MacOSX /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages is added to
  the end sys.path, for compatibility with the system install of Python.

- Issue #4688: Add a heuristic so that tuples and dicts containing only
  untrackable objects are not tracked by the garbage collector. This can
  reduce the size of collections and therefore the garbage collection overhead
  on long-running programs, depending on their particular use of datatypes.

- Issue #5512: Rewrite PyLong long division algorithm (x_divrem) to
  improve its performance.  Long divisions and remainder operations
  are now between 50% and 150% faster.

- Issue #4258: Make it possible to use base 2**30 instead of base
  2**15 for the internal representation of integers, for performance
  reasons.  Base 2**30 is enabled by default on 64-bit machines.  Add
  --enable-big-digits option to configure, which overrides the
  default.  Add sys.int_info structseq to provide information about
  the internal format.

- Issue #4474: PyUnicode_FromWideChar now converts characters outside
  the BMP to surrogate pairs, on systems with sizeof(wchar_t) == 4
  and sizeof(Py_UNICODE) == 2.

- Issue #5237: Allow auto-numbered fields in str.format(). For
  example: '{} {}'.format(1, 2) == '1 2'.

- Issue #5392: when a very low recursion limit was set, the interpreter would
  abort with a fatal error after the recursion limit was hit twice.

- Issue #3845: In PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags avoid invalid memory access with
  short file names.

  error substitutions from non-strict codec error callbacks in
  incrementalencoder and StreamWriter.

- Issue #5656: Fix the coverage reporting when running the test suite with
  the -T argument.

- Issue #5387: Fixed mmap.move crash by integer overflow.

- Issue #5261: Patch multiprocessing's semaphore.c to support context
  manager use: "with multiprocessing.Lock()" works now.

- Issue #5236: Change time.strptime() to only take strings. Didn't work with
  bytes already but the failure was non-obvious.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #5391: mmap now deals exclusively with bytes.

- Issue #5463: In struct module, remove deprecated overflow wrapping
  when packing an integer: struct.pack('=L', -1) now raises
  struct.error instead of returning b'\xff\xff\xff\xff'.  The
  _PY_STRUCT_RANGE_CHECKING and _PY_STRUCT_OVERFLOW_MASKING constants
  have been removed from the struct module.


What's New in Python 3.1 alpha 1
================================

*Release date: 2009-03-07*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- The io module has been reimplemented in C for speed.

- Give dict views an informative __repr__.

- Issue #5247: Improve error message when unknown format codes are
  used when using str.format() with str, int, and float arguments.

- Issue #5249: time.strftime returned malformed string when format string
  contained non ascii character on windows.

- Issue #4626: compile(), exec(), and eval() ignore the coding cookie if the
  source has already been decoded into str.

- Issue #5186: Reduce hash collisions for objects with no __hash__ method by
  rotating the object pointer by 4 bits to the right.

- Issue #4575: Fix Py_IS_INFINITY macro to work correctly on x87 FPUs:
  it now forces its argument to double before testing for infinity.

- Issue #5137: Make len() correctly raise a TypeError when a __len__ method
  returns a non-number type.

- Issue #5182: Removed memoryview.__str__.

- Issue #1717: Removed builtin cmp() function, dropped tp_compare
  slot, the C API functions PyObject_Compare and PyUnicode_Compare and
  the type definition cmpfunc.  The tp_compare slot has been renamed
  to tp_reserved, and is reserved for future usage.

- Issue #1242657: the __len__() and __length_hint__() calls in several tools
  were suppressing all exceptions.  These include list() and bytearray().

- Issue #4707: round(x, n) now returns an integer if x is an integer.
  Previously it returned a float.

- Issue #4753: By enabling a configure option named '--with-computed-gotos'
  on compilers that support it (notably: gcc, SunPro, icc), the bytecode
  evaluation loop is compiled with a new dispatch mechanism which gives
  speedups of up to 20%, depending on the system, on various benchmarks.

- Issue #4874: Most builtin decoders now reject unicode input.

- Issue #4842: Don't allow trailing 'L' when constructing an integer
  from a string.

- Issue #4991: os.fdopen now raises an OSError for invalid file descriptors.

- Issue #4838: When a module is deallocated, free the memory backing the
  optional module state data.

- Issue #4910: Rename nb_long slot to nb_reserved, and change its
  type to ``(void *)``.

- Issue #4935: The overflow checking code in the expandtabs() method common
  to str, bytes and bytearray could be optimized away by the compiler, letting
  the interpreter segfault instead of raising an error.

- Issue #3720: Fix a crash when an iterator modifies its class and removes its
  __next__ method.

- Issue #4910: Builtin int() function and PyNumber_Long/PyNumber_Int API
  function no longer attempt to call the __long__ slot to convert an object
  to an integer.  Only the __int__ and __trunc__ slots are examined.

- Issue #4893: Use NT threading on CE.

- Issue #4915: Port sysmodule to Windows CE.

- Issue #4868: utf-8, utf-16 and latin1 decoding are now 2x to 4x faster. The
  common cases are optimized thanks to a dedicated fast path and a moderate
  amount of loop unrolling.

- Issue #4074: Change the criteria for doing a full garbage collection (i.e.
  collecting the oldest generation) so that allocating lots of objects without
  destroying them does not show quadratic performance. Based on a proposal by
  Martin von Löwis at
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-June/080579.html.

- Issue #4604: Some objects of the I/O library could still be used after
  having been closed (for instance, a read() call could return some
  previously buffered data). Patch by Dmitry Vasiliev.

- Issue #4705: Fix the -u ("unbuffered binary stdout and stderr") command-line
  flag to work properly. Furthermore, when specifying -u, the text stdout
  and stderr streams have line-by-line buffering enabled (the default being
  to buffer arbitrary chunks of data).

- The internal table, _PyLong_DigitValue, is now an array of unsigned chars
  instead of ints (reducing its size from 4 to 8 times thereby reducing
  Python's overall memory).

- Issue #1180193: When importing a module from a .pyc (or .pyo) file with
  an existing .py counterpart, override the co_filename attributes of all
  code objects if the original filename is obsolete (which can happen if the
  file has been renamed, moved, or if it is accessed through different paths).
  Patch by Ziga Seilnacht and Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #4580: Fix slicing of memoryviews when the item size is greater than
  one byte. Also fixes the meaning of len() so that it returns the number of
  items, rather than the size in bytes.

- Issue #4075: Use OutputDebugStringW in Py_FatalError.

- Issue #4747: When the terminal does not use utf-8, executing a script with
  non-ascii characters in its name could fail with a "SyntaxError: None" error.

- Issue #4797: IOError.filename was not set when ``_fileio.FileIO`` failed
  to open file with a bytes filename on Windows.

- Issue #3680: Reference cycles created through a dict, set or deque iterator
  did not get collected.

- Issue #4701: PyObject_Hash now implicitly calls PyType_Ready on types
  where the tp_hash and tp_dict slots are both NULL.

- Issue #4759: None is now allowed as the first argument of
  bytearray.translate().  It was always allowed for bytes.translate().

- Added test case to ensure attempts to read from a file opened for writing
  fail.

- Issue #3106: Speedup some comparisons (str/str and int/int).

- Issue #2183: Simplify and optimize bytecode for list, dict and set
  comprehensions. Original patch for list comprehensions by Neal Norwitz.

- Issue #2467: gc.DEBUG_STATS reported invalid elapsed times. Also, always
  print elapsed times, not only when some objects are uncollectable /
  unreachable. Original patch by Neil Schemenauer.

- Issue #3439: Add a bit_length method to int.

- Issue #2173: When getting device encoding, check that return value of
  nl_langinfo is not the empty string.  This was causing silent build
  failures on OS X.

- Issue #4597: Fixed several opcodes that weren't always propagating
  exceptions.

- Issue #4589: Fixed exception handling when the __exit__ function of a
  context manager returns a value that cannot be converted to a bool.

- Issue #4445: Replace "sizeof(PyBytesObject)" with
  "offsetof(PyBytesObject, ob_sval) + 1" when allocating memory for
  bytes instances.  On a typical machine this saves 3 bytes of memory
  (on average) per allocation of a bytes instance.

- Issue #4533: File read operation was dreadfully slow due to a slowly
  growing read buffer. Fixed by using the same growth rate algorithm as
  Python 2.x.

- Issue #4509: Various issues surrounding resize of bytearray objects to
  which there are buffer exports (e.g. memoryview instances).

- Issue #4233: Changed semantic of ``_fileio.FileIO``'s ``close()``
  method on file objects with closefd=False. The file descriptor is still
  kept open but the file object behaves like a closed file. The ``FileIO``
  object also got a new readonly attribute ``closefd``.

- Issue #4569: Interpreter crash when mutating a memoryview with an item size
  larger than 1.

- Issue #4748: Lambda generators no longer return a value.

- The re.sub(), re.subn() and re.split() functions now accept a flags parameter.

- Issue #5108: Handle %s like %S, %R and %A in PyUnicode_FromFormatV(): Call
  PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8() once, remember the result and output it in a second
  step. This avoids problems with counting UTF-8 bytes that ignores the effect
  of using the replace error handler in PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8().

  traditional 2.x file object.

- Issue #5013: Fixed a bug in FileHandler which occurred when the delay
  parameter was set.

- Issue #4201: pdb can now access and display source code loaded via
  zipimport (or any other conformant PEP 302 loader). Original patch by
  Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issue #4197: doctests in modules loaded via zipimport (or any other PEP
  302 conformant loader) will now work correctly in most cases (they
  are still subject to the constraints that exist for all code running
  from inside a module loaded via a PEP 302 loader and attempting to
  perform IO operations based on __file__). Original patch by
  Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issues #4082 and #4512: Add runpy support to zipimport in a manner that
  allows backporting to maintenance branches. Original patch by

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #3745: Fix hashlib to always reject unicode and non buffer-api
  supporting objects as input no matter how it was compiled (built in
  implementations or external openssl library).

- Issue #4397: Fix occasional test_socket failure on OS X.

- Issue #4279: Fix build of parsermodule under Cygwin.

- Issue #4751: hashlib now releases the GIL when hashing large buffers
  (with a hardwired threshold of 2048 bytes), allowing better parallelization
  on multi-CPU systems. Contributed by Lukas Lueg (ebfe) and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #4051: Prevent conflict of UNICODE macros in cPickle.

- Issue #4738: Each zlib object now has a separate lock, allowing to compress
  or decompress several streams at once on multi-CPU systems. Also, the GIL
  is now released when computing the CRC of a large buffer. Patch by ebfe.

- Issue #4228: Pack negative values the same way as 2.4 in struct's L format.

- Issue #1040026: Fix os.times result on systems where HZ is incorrect.

- Issues #3167, #3682: Fix test_math failures for log, log10 on Solaris,
  OpenBSD.

- Issue #4583: array.array would not always prohibit resizing when a buffer
  has been exported, resulting in an interpreter crash when accessing the
  buffer.


- Issue #5228: Make functools.partial objects can now be pickled.

Tests
-----

- Issue #6152: New option '-j'/'--multiprocess' for regrtest allows running
  regression tests in parallel, shortening the total runtime.

- Issue #5450: Moved tests involving loading tk from Lib/test/test_tcl to
  Lib/tkinter/test/test_tkinter/test_loadtk. With this, these tests demonstrate
  the same behaviour as test_ttkguionly (and now also test_tk) which is to
  skip the tests if DISPLAY is defined but can't be used.

- regrtest no longer treats ImportError as equivalent to SkipTest.  Imports
  that should cause a test to be skipped are now done using import_module
  from test support, which does the conversion.

- Issue #5083: New 'gui' resource for regrtest.
