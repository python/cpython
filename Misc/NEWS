  for bound methods.

- Issue #20566: Change asyncio.as_completed() to use a Queue, to
  avoid O(N**2) behavior.

  BaseEventLoop.set_debug() and BaseEventLoop.get_debug().
  Add support for setting 'asyncio.tasks._DEBUG' variable with
  'PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG' environment variable.

- asyncio: Refactoring and fixes: BaseEventLoop.sock_connect() raises an
  error if the address is not resolved; use __slots__ in Handle and
  TimerHandle; as_completed() and wait() raise TypeError if the passed
  list of Futures is a single Future; call_soon() and other 'call_*()'
  functions raise TypeError if the passed callback is a coroutine
  function; _ProactorBasePipeTransport uses _FlowControlMixin;
  WriteTransport.set_write_buffer_size() calls _maybe_pause_protocol()

  streams.open_unix_connection(), and streams.start_unix_server().

- Issue #20616: Add a format() method to tracemalloc.Traceback.

- Issue #19744: the ensurepip installation step now just prints a warning to
  stderr rather than failing outright if SSL/TLS is unavailable. This allows
  local installation of POSIX builds without SSL/TLS support.

- Issue #20594: Avoid name clash with the libc function posix_close.

Build
-----

What's New in Python 3.4.0 release candidate 1?
===============================================

Release date: 2014-02-10

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #19255: The builtins module is restored to initial value before
  cleaning other modules.  The sys and builtins modules are cleaned last.

- Issue #20588: Make Python-ast.c C89 compliant.

- Issue #20437: Fixed 22 potential bugs when deleting objects references.

- Issue #20500: Displaying an exception at interpreter shutdown no longer
  risks triggering an assertion failure in PyObject_Str.

- Issue #20538: UTF-7 incremental decoder produced inconsistent string when
  input was truncated in BASE64 section.

- Issue #20404: io.TextIOWrapper (and hence the open() builtin) now uses the
  internal codec marking system added for issue #19619 to throw LookupError
  for known non-text encodings at stream construction time. The existing
  output type checks remain in place to deal with unmarked third party
  codecs.

- Issue #17162: Add PyType_GetSlot.

- Issue #20162: Fix an alignment issue in the siphash24() hash function which
  caused a crash on PowerPC 64-bit (ppc64).

Library
-------

- Issue #20530: The signatures for slot builtins have been updated
  to reflect the fact that they only accept positional-only arguments.

- Issue #20517: Functions in the os module that accept two filenames
  now register both filenames in the exception on failure.

- Issue #20563: The ipaddress module API is now considered stable.

- Issue #14983: email.generator now always adds a line end after each MIME
  boundary marker, instead of doing so only when there is an epilogue.  This
  fixes an RFC compliance bug and solves an issue with signed MIME parts.

- Issue #20540: Fix a performance regression (vs. Python 3.2) when layering
  a multiprocessing Connection over a TCP socket.  For small payloads, Nagle's
  algorithm would introduce idle delays before the entire transmission of a
  message.

- Issue #16983: the new email header parsing code will now decode encoded words
  that are (incorrectly) surrounded by quotes, and register a defect.

- Issue #19772: email.generator no longer mutates the message object when
  doing a down-transform from 8bit to 7bit CTEs.

- Issue #20536: the statistics module now correctly handle Decimal instances
  with positive exponents

- Issue #18805: the netmask/hostmask parsing in ipaddress now more reliably
  filters out illegal values and correctly allows any valid prefix length.

- Issue #20481: For at least Python 3.4, the statistics module will require
  that all inputs for a single operation be of a single consistent type, or
  else a mixed of ints and a single other consistent type. This avoids
  some interoperability issues that arose with the previous approach of
  coercing to a suitable common type.

- Issue #20478: the statistics module now treats collections.Counter inputs
  like any other iterable.

- Issue #17369: get_filename was raising an exception if the filename
  parameter's RFC2231 encoding was broken in certain ways.  This was
  a regression relative to python2.

- Issue #20013: Some imap servers disconnect if the current mailbox is
  deleted, and imaplib did not handle that case gracefully.  Now it
  handles the 'bye' correctly.

- Issue #20531: Revert 3.4 version of fix for #19063, and apply the 3.3
  version.  That is, do *not* raise an error if unicode is passed to
  email.message.Message.set_payload.

- Issue #20476: If a non-compat32 policy is used with any of the email parsers,
  EmailMessage is now used as the factory class.  The factory class should
  really come from the policy; that will get fixed in 3.5.

- Issue #19920: TarFile.list() no longer fails when outputs a listing
  containing non-encodable characters.  Based on patch by Vajrasky Kok.

- Issue #20515: Fix NULL pointer dereference introduced by issue #20368.

- Issue #19186: Restore namespacing of expat symbols inside the pyexpat module.

- Issue #20053: ensurepip (and hence venv) are no longer affected by the
  settings in the default pip configuration file.

- Issue #20426: When passing the re.DEBUG flag, re.compile() displays the
  debug output every time it is called, regardless of the compilation cache.

- Issue #20368: The null character now correctly passed from Tcl to Python.
  Improved error handling in variables-related commands.

- Issue #20435: Fix _pyio.StringIO.getvalue() to take into account newline
  translation settings.

- tracemalloc: Fix slicing traces and fix slicing a traceback.

- Issue #20354: Fix an alignment issue in the tracemalloc module on 64-bit
  platforms. Bug seen on 64-bit Linux when using "make profile-opt".

- Issue #17159: inspect.signature now accepts duck types of functions,
  which adds support for Cython functions. Initial patch by Stefan Behnel.

- Issue #18801: Fix inspect.classify_class_attrs to correctly classify
  object.__new__ and object.__init__.

- Fixed cmath.isinf's name in its argument parsing code.

- Issue #20311, #20452: poll and epoll now round the timeout away from zero,
  instead of rounding towards zero, in select and selectors modules:
  select.epoll.poll(), selectors.PollSelector.poll() and
  selectors.EpollSelector.poll(). For example, a timeout of one microsecond
  (1e-6) is now rounded to one millisecondi (1e-3), instead of being rounded to
  zero.  However, the granularity property and asyncio's resolution feature
  were removed again.

- asyncio: Some refactoring; various fixes; add write flow control to
  unix pipes; Future.set_exception() instantiates the exception
  argument if it is a class; improved proactor pipe transport; support
  wait_for(f, None); don't log broken/disconnected pipes; use
  ValueError instead of assert for forbidden subprocess_{shell,exec}
  arguments; added a convenience API for subprocess management; added
  StreamReader.at_eof(); properly handle duplicate coroutines/futures
  in gather(), wait(), as_completed(); use a bytearray for buffering
  in StreamReader; and more.

- Issue #20288: fix handling of invalid numeric charrefs in HTMLParser.

- Issue #20424: Python implementation of io.StringIO now supports lone surrogates.

- Issue #20308: inspect.signature now works on classes without user-defined
  __init__ or __new__ methods.

- Issue #20372: inspect.getfile (and a bunch of other inspect functions that
  use it) doesn't crash with unexpected AttributeError on classes defined in C
  without __module__.

- Issue #20356: inspect.signature formatting uses '/' to separate
  positional-only parameters from others.

- Issue #20223: inspect.signature now supports methods defined with
  functools.partialmethods.

- Issue #19456: ntpath.join() now joins relative paths correctly when a drive
  is present.

- Issue #19077: tempfile.TemporaryDirectory cleanup no longer fails when
  called during shutdown.  Emitting resource warning in __del__ no longer fails.
  Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.

- Issue #20394: Silence Coverity warning in audioop module.

- Issue #20367: Fix behavior of concurrent.futures.as_completed() for
  duplicate arguments.  Patch by Glenn Langford.

- Issue #8260: The read(), readline() and readlines() methods of
  codecs.StreamReader returned incomplete data when were called after
  readline() or read(size).  Based on patch by Amaury Forgeot d'Arc.

- Issue #20105: the codec exception chaining now correctly sets the
  traceback of the original exception as its __traceback__ attribute.

- Issue #17481: inspect.getfullargspec() now uses inspect.signature() API.

- Issue #15304: concurrent.futures.wait() can block forever even if
  Futures have completed. Patch by Glenn Langford.

- Issue #14455: plistlib: fix serializing integers integers in the range
  of an unsigned long long but outside of the range of signed long long for
  binary plist files.

IDLE
----

- Issue #20406: Use Python application icons for Idle window title bars.
  Patch mostly by Serhiy Storchaka.

- Update the python.gif icon for the Idle classbrowser and pathbowser
  from the old green snake to the new new blue and yellow snakes.

- Issue #17721: Remove non-functional configuration dialog help button until we
  make it actually gives some help when clicked. Patch by Guilherme Simões.

Tests
-----

- Issue #20532: Tests which use _testcapi now are marked as CPython only.

- Issue #19920: Added tests for TarFile.list().  Based on patch by Vajrasky Kok.

- Issue #19990: Added tests for the imghdr module.  Based on patch by
  Claudiu Popa.

- Issue #20474: Fix test_socket "unexpected success" failures on OS X 10.7+.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #20530: Argument Clinic's signature format has been revised again.
  The new syntax is highly human readable while still preventing false
  positives.  The syntax also extends Python syntax to denote "self" and
  positional-only parameters, allowing inspect.Signature objects to be
  totally accurate for all supported builtins in Python 3.4.

- Issue #20456: Argument Clinic now observes the C preprocessor conditional
  compilation statements of the C files it parses.  When a Clinic block is
  inside a conditional code, it adjusts its output to match, including
  automatically generating an empty methoddef macro.

- Issue #20456: Cloned functions in Argument Clinic now use the correct
  name, not the name of the function they were cloned from, for text
  strings inside generated code.

- Issue #20456: Fixed Argument Clinic's test suite and "--converters" feature.

- Issue #20456: Argument Clinic now allows specifying different names
  for a parameter in Python and C, using "as" on the parameter line.

- Issue #20326: Argument Clinic now uses a simple, unique signature to
  annotate text signatures in docstrings, resulting in fewer false
  positives.  "self" parameters are also explicitly marked, allowing
  inspect.Signature() to authoritatively detect (and skip) said parameters.

- Issue #20326: Argument Clinic now generates separate checksums for the
  input and output sections of the block, allowing external tools to verify
  that the input has not changed (and thus the output is not out-of-date).

Build
-----

- Issue #20465: Update SQLite shipped with OS X installer to 3.8.3.

C-API
-----

- Issue #20517: Added new functions allowing OSError exceptions to reference
  two filenames instead of one: PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilenameObjects() and
  PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilenameObjects().

Documentation
-------------

- Issue #20488: Change wording to say importlib is *the* implementation of
  import instead of just *an* implementation.

- Issue #6386: Clarify in the tutorial that specifying a symlink to execute
  means the directory containing the executed script and not the symlink is
  added to sys.path.


What's New in Python 3.4.0 Beta 3?
==================================

Release date: 2014-01-26

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #20189: Four additional builtin types (PyTypeObject,
  PyMethodDescr_Type, _PyMethodWrapper_Type, and PyWrapperDescr_Type)
  have been modified to provide introspection information for builtins.

- Issue #17825: Cursor "^" is correctly positioned for SyntaxError and
  IndentationError.

- Issue #2382: SyntaxError cursor "^" is now written at correct position in most
  cases when multibyte characters are in line (before "^").  This still not
  works correctly with wide East Asian characters.

- Issue #18960: The first line of Python script could be executed twice when
  the source encoding was specified on the second line.  Now the source encoding
  declaration on the second line isn't effective if the first line contains
  anything except a comment.  'python -x' works now again with files with the
  source encoding declarations, and can be used to make Python batch files
  on Windows.

Library
-------

- asyncio: Various improvements and small changes not all covered by
  issues listed below.  E.g. wait_for() now cancels the inner task if
  the timeout occcurs; tweaked the set of exported symbols; renamed
  Empty/Full to QueueEmpty/QueueFull; "with (yield from lock)" now
  uses a separate context manager; readexactly() raises if not enough
  data was read; PTY support tweaks.

- Issue #20311: asyncio: Add a granularity attribute to BaseEventLoop: maximum

- Issue #20189: unittest.mock now no longer assumes that any object for
  which it could get an inspect.Signature is a callable written in Python.
  Fix courtesy of Michael Foord.

- Issue #20317: ExitStack.__exit__ could create a self-referential loop if an
  exception raised by a cleanup operation already had its context set
  correctly (for example, by the @contextmanager decorator). The infinite
  loop this caused is now avoided by checking if the expected context is
  already set before trying to fix it.

  invalid fileobj.

- Issue #20152: Ported Python/import.c over to Argument Clinic.

- Issue #13107: argparse and optparse no longer raises an exception when output

  "{dirname}/clinic/{basename}.h".

- Issue #20390: Argument Clinic's "class" directive syntax has been extended
  with two new required  arguments: "typedef" and "type_object".

- Issue #20390: Argument Clinic: If __new__ or __init__ functions didn't use
  kwargs (or args), the PyArg_NoKeywords (or PyArg_NoPositional) calls
  generated are only run when the type object is an exact match.

- Issue #20390: Argument Clinic now fails if you have required parameters after
  optional parameters.

- Issue #20390: Argument Clinic converters now have a new template they can
  inject code into: "modifiers".  Code put there is run in the parsing
  function after argument parsing but before the call to the impl.

- Issue #20376: Argument Clinic now escapes backslashes in docstrings.

- Issue #20381: Argument Clinic now sanity checks the default argument when
  c_default is also specified, providing a nice failure message for
  disallowed values.

- Issue #20189: Argument Clinic now ensures that parser functions for
  __new__ are always of type newfunc, the type of the tp_new slot.
  Similarly, parser functions for __init__ are now always of type initproc,
  the type of tp_init.

- Issue #20189: Argument Clinic now suppresses the docstring for __new__
  and __init__ functions if no docstring is provided in the input.

- Issue #20189: Argument Clinic now suppresses the "self" parameter in the
  impl for @staticmethod functions.

- Issue #20294: Argument Clinic now supports argument parsing for __new__ and
  __init__ functions.

- Issue #20299: Argument Clinic custom converters may now change the default
  value of c_default and py_default with a class member.

- Issue #20287: Argument Clinic's output is now configurable, allowing
  delaying its output or even redirecting it to a separate file.

- Issue #20226: Argument Clinic now permits simple expressions
  (e.g. "sys.maxsize - 1") as default values for parameters.

- Issue #19936: Added executable bits or shebang lines to Python scripts which
  requires them.  Disable executable bits and shebang lines in test and
  benchmark files in order to prevent using a random system python, and in

What's New in Python 3.4.0 Beta 2?
==================================

Release date: 2014-01-05

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #17432: Drop UCS2 from names of Unicode functions in python3.def.

- Issue #19526: Exclude all new API from the stable ABI. Exceptions can be
  made if a need is demonstrated.

- Issue #19969: PyBytes_FromFormatV() now raises an OverflowError if "%c"
  argument is not in range [0; 255].

- Issue #19995: %c, %o, %x, and %X now issue a DeprecationWarning on non-integer
  input; reworded docs to clarify that an integer type should define both __int__
  and __index__.

- Issue #19787: PyThread_set_key_value() now always set the value. In Python
  3.3, the function did nothing if the key already exists (if the current value
  is a non-NULL pointer).

- Issue #14432: Remove the thread state field from the frame structure. Fix a
  crash when a generator is created in a C thread that is destroyed while the
  generator is still used. The issue was that a generator contains a frame, and
  the frame kept a reference to the Python state of the destroyed C thread. The
  crash occurs when a trace function is setup.

- Issue #19576: PyGILState_Ensure() now initializes threads. At startup, Python
  has no concrete GIL. If PyGILState_Ensure() is called from a new thread for
  the first time and PyEval_InitThreads() was not called yet, a GIL needs to be
  created.

- Issue #17576: Deprecation warning emitted now when __int__() or __index__()
  return not int instance.

- Issue #19932: Fix typo in import.h, missing whitespaces in function prototypes.

- Issue #19736: Add module-level statvfs constants defined for GNU/glibc
  based systems.

- Issue #20097: Fix bad use of "self" in importlib's WindowsRegistryFinder.

- Issue #19729: In str.format(), fix recursive expansion in format spec.

- Issue #19918: Fix PurePath.relative_to() under Windows.

- Issue #19422: Explicitly disallow non-SOCK_STREAM sockets in the ssl
  module, rather than silently let them emit clear text data.

- Issue #20046: Locale alias table no longer contains entities which can be
  calculated.  Generalized support of the euro modifier.

- Issue #20027: Fixed locale aliases for devanagari locales.

- Issue #20067: Tkinter variables now work when wantobjects is false.

- Issue #19020: Tkinter now uses splitlist() instead of split() in configure
  methods.

- Issue #19744: ensurepip now provides a better error message when Python is
  built without SSL/TLS support (pip currently requires that support to run,
  even if only operating with local wheel files)

- Issue #19734: ensurepip now ignores all pip environment variables to avoid
  odd behaviour based on user configuration settings

- Fix TypeError on "setup.py upload --show-response".

  the file before the method is possibly called.

- Issue #20037: Avoid crashes when opening a text file late at interpreter
  shutdown.

- Issue #19967: Thanks to the PEP 442, asyncio.Future now uses a
  destructor to log uncaught exceptions, instead of the dedicated
  _TracebackLogger class.

- Added a Task.current_task() class method to asyncio.

- Issue #19850: Set SA_RESTART in asyncio when registering a signal
  handler to limit EINTR occurrences.

- Implemented write flow control in asyncio for proactor event loop (Windows).

- Change write buffer in asyncio use to avoid O(N**2) behavior.  Make
  write()/sendto() accept bytearray/memoryview.

  from X.org distribution using makelocalealias.py.

- Issue #5815: Fixed support for locales with modifiers.  Fixed support for
  locale encodings with hyphens.

- Issue #20026: Fix the sqlite module to handle correctly invalid isolation
  level (wrong type).

- Issue #18829: csv.Dialect() now checks type for delimiter, escapechar and
  quotechar fields.  Original patch by Vajrasky Kok.

- Issue #19855: uuid.getnode() on Unix now looks on the PATH for the
  executables used to find the mac address, with /sbin and /usr/sbin as
  fallbacks.

- Issue #20007: HTTPResponse.read(0) no more prematurely closes connection.
  Original patch by Simon Sapin.

- Issue #19946: multiprocessing now uses runpy to initialize __main__ in
  child processes when necessary, allowing it to correctly handle scripts
  without suffixes and submodules that use explicit relative imports or
  otherwise rely on parent modules being correctly imported prior to
  execution.

- Issue #19921: When Path.mkdir() is called with parents=True, any missing
  parent is created with the default permissions, ignoring the mode argument
  (mimicking the POSIX "mkdir -p" command).

- Issue #19887: Improve the Path.resolve() algorithm to support certain
  symlink chains.

- Issue #19912: Fixed numerous bugs in ntpath.splitunc().

- Issue #19911: ntpath.splitdrive() now correctly processes the 'İ' character
  (U+0130, LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE).

- Issue #19532: python -m compileall with no filename/directory arguments now
  respects the -f and -q flags instead of ignoring them.

- Issue #19623: Fixed writing to unseekable files in the aifc module.

- Issue #19946: multiprocessing.spawn now raises ImportError when the module to
  be used as the main module cannot be imported.

- Issue #17919: select.poll.register() again works with poll.POLLNVAL on AIX.
  Fixed integer overflow in the eventmask parameter.

- Issue #19063: if a Charset's body_encoding was set to None, the email
  package would generate a message claiming the Content-Transfer-Encoding
  was 7bit, and produce garbage output for the content.  This now works.
  A couple of other set_payload mishandlings of non-ASCII are also fixed.
  In addition, calling set_payload with a string argument without
  specifying a charset now raises an error (this is a new error in 3.4).

- Issue #15475: Add __sizeof__ implementations for itertools objects.

- Issue #19944: Fix importlib.find_spec() so it imports parents as needed
  and move the function to importlib.util.

- Issue #19880: Fix a reference leak in unittest.TestCase. Explicitly break
  reference cycles between frames and the _Outcome instance.

- Issue #17429: platform.linux_distribution() now decodes files from the UTF-8
  encoding with the surrogateescape error handler, instead of decoding from the
  locale encoding in strict mode. It fixes the function on Fedora 19 which is
  probably the first major distribution release with a non-ASCII name. Patch
  written by Toshio Kuratomi.

- Issue #19343: Expose FreeBSD-specific APIs in resource module.  Original
  patch by Koobs.

- Issue #19929: Call os.read with 32768 within subprocess.Popen.communicate
  rather than 4096 for efficiency.  A microbenchmark shows Linux and OS X
  both using ~50% less cpu time this way.

- Issue #19506: Use a memoryview to avoid a data copy when piping data
  to stdin within subprocess.Popen.communicate.  5-10% less cpu usage.

- Issue #19876: selectors unregister() no longer raises ValueError or OSError
  if the FD is closed (as long as it was registered).

  is present.  Original patch by Antoine Pitrou.

- Issue #19296: Silence compiler warning in dbm_open

- Issue #6784: Strings from Python 2 can now be unpickled as bytes
  objects by setting the encoding argument of Unpickler to be 'bytes'.
  Initial patch by Merlijn van Deen.

- Issue #19839: Fix regression in bz2 module's handling of non-bzip2 data at
  EOF, and analogous bug in lzma module.

- Issue #19881: Fix pickling bug where cpickle would emit bad pickle data for
  large bytes string (i.e., with size greater than 2**32-1).

- Issue #19138: doctest's IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL now allows a match when
  no exception detail exists (no colon following the exception's name, or
  a colon does follow but no text follows the colon).

- Issue #19927: Add __eq__ to path-based loaders in importlib.

- Issue #19827: On UNIX, setblocking() and settimeout() methods of
  socket.socket can now avoid a second syscall if the ioctl() function can be
  used, or if the non-blocking flag of the socket is unchanged.

- Issue #19785: smtplib now supports SSLContext.check_hostname and server name
  indication for TLS/SSL connections.

  descriptor 0, 1 or 2 is closed.

- Issue #17897: Optimized unpickle prefetching.

  constructor is given a str. Move the array module typecode documentation to
  the docstring of the constructor.

What's New in Python 3.4.0 Beta 1?
==================================

Release date: 2013-11-24

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Use the repr of a module name in more places in import, especially
  exceptions.

- Issue #19619: str.encode, bytes.decode and bytearray.decode now use an
  internal API to throw LookupError for known non-text encodings, rather
  than attempting the encoding or decoding operation and then throwing a
  TypeError for an unexpected output type. (The latter mechanism remains
  in place for third party non-text encodings)

- Issue #19183: Implement PEP 456 'secure and interchangeable hash algorithm'.
  Python now uses SipHash24 on all major platforms.

- Issue #12892: The utf-16* and utf-32* encoders no longer allow surrogate code
  points (U+D800-U+DFFF) to be encoded.  The utf-32* decoders no longer decode
  byte sequences that correspond to surrogate code points.  The surrogatepass
  error handler now works with the utf-16* and utf-32* codecs.  Based on
  patches by Victor Stinner and Kang-Hao (Kenny) Lu.

- Issue #17806: Added keyword-argument support for "tabsize" to
  str/bytes.expandtabs().

- Issue #17828: Output type errors in str.encode(), bytes.decode() and
  bytearray.decode() now direct users to codecs.encode() or codecs.decode()
  as appropriate.

- Issue #17828: The interpreter now attempts to chain errors that occur in
  codec processing with a replacement exception of the same type that
  includes the codec name in the error message. It ensures it only does this
  when the creation of the replacement exception won't lose any information.

- Issue #19466: Clear the frames of daemon threads earlier during the
  Python shutdown to call objects destructors. So "unclosed file" resource
  warnings are now corretly emitted for daemon threads.

- Issue #19514: Deduplicate some _Py_IDENTIFIER declarations.
  Patch by Andrei Dorian Duma.

- Issue #17936: Fix O(n**2) behaviour when adding or removing many subclasses
  of a given type.

- Issue #19428: zipimport now handles errors when reading truncated or invalid
  ZIP archive.

- Issue #18408: Add a new PyFrame_FastToLocalsWithError() function to handle
  exceptions when merging fast locals into f_locals of a frame.
  PyEval_GetLocals() now raises an exception and return NULL on failure.

- Issue #19369: Optimized the usage of __length_hint__().

- Issue #18603: Ensure that PyOS_mystricmp and PyOS_mystrnicmp are in the
  Python executable and not removed by the linker's optimizer.

- Issue #19306: Add extra hints to the faulthandler module's stack
  dumps that these are "upside down".

Library
-------

- Issue #3158: doctest can now find doctests in functions and methods
  written in C.

- Issue #13477: Added command line interface to the tarfile module.
  Original patch by Berker Peksag.

- Issue #19674: inspect.signature() now produces a correct signature
  for some builtins.

- Issue #19722: Added opcode.stack_effect(), which
  computes the stack effect of bytecode instructions.

- Issue #19735: Implement private function ssl._create_stdlib_context() to
  create SSLContext objects in Python's stdlib module. It provides a single
  configuration point and makes use of SSLContext.load_default_certs().

- Issue #16203: Add re.fullmatch() function and regex.fullmatch() method,
  which anchor the pattern at both ends of the string to match.
  Original patch by Matthew Barnett.

- Issue #13592: Improved the repr for regular expression pattern objects.
  Based on patch by Hugo Lopes Tavares.

- Issue #19641: Added the audioop.byteswap() function to convert big-endian
  samples to little-endian and vice versa.

  certificates from default stores or system stores. By default the method
  loads CA certs for authentication of server certs.

- Issue #19673: Add pathlib to the stdlib as a provisional module (PEP 428).

- Issue #16596: pdb in a generator now properly skips over yield and
  yield from rather than stepping out of the generator into its
  caller.  (This is essential for stepping through asyncio coroutines.)

- Issue #17916: Added dis.Bytecode.from_traceback() and
  dis.Bytecode.current_offset to easily display "current instruction"
  markers in the new disassembly API (Patch by Claudiu Popa).

- Issue #19552: venv now supports bootstrapping pip into virtual environments

- Issue #17134: Finalize interface to Windows' certificate store. Cert and
  CRL enumeration are now two functions. enum_certificates() also returns
  purpose flags as set of OIDs.

- Issue #19555: Restore sysconfig.get_config_var('SO'), (and the distutils
  equivalent) with a DeprecationWarning pointing people at $EXT_SUFFIX.

- Issue #8813: Add SSLContext.verify_flags to change the verification flags
  of the context in order to enable certification revocation list (CRL)
  checks or strict X509 rules.

  and CRL distribution points.

- Issue #18138: Implement cadata argument of SSLContext.load_verify_location()
  to load CA certificates and CRL from memory. It supports PEM and DER
  encoded strings.

- Issue #18775: Add name and block_size attribute to HMAC object. They now
  provide the same API elements as non-keyed cryptographic hash functions.

- Issue #17276: MD5 as default digestmod for HMAC is deprecated. The HMAC
  module supports digestmod names, e.g. hmac.HMAC('sha1').

- Issue #19449: in csv's writerow, handle non-string keys when generating the
  error message that certain keys are not in the 'fieldnames' list.

- Issue #13633: Added a new convert_charrefs keyword arg to HTMLParser that,
  when True, automatically converts all character references.

- Issue #8402: Added the escape() function to the glob module.

- Issue #17618: Add Base85 and Ascii85 encoding/decoding to the base64 module.

- Issue #19634: time.strftime("%y") now raises a ValueError on AIX when given a
  year before 1900.

  on a system with SO_REUSEPORT defined in the headers but run on a system
  with an OS kernel that does not support that reasonably new socket option.

- Fix compilation error under gcc of the ctypes module bundled libffi for arm.

- Issue #19448: Add private API to SSL module to lookup ASN.1 objects by OID,
  NID, short name and long name.

  sunau, and wave modules.

- Issue #5202: Added support for unseekable files in the wave module.

- Issue #19544 and Issue #1180: Restore global option to ignore
  ~/.pydistutils.cfg in Distutils, accidentally removed in backout of
  distutils2 changes.

- Issue #19523: Closed FileHandler leak which occurred when delay was set.

- Issue #19544 and Issue #6516: Restore support for --user and --group
  parameters to sdist command accidentally rolled back as part of the
  distutils2 rollback.

- Issue #13674: Prevented time.strftime from crashing on Windows when given
  a year before 1900 and a format of %y.

- Issue #19406: implementation of the ensurepip module (part of PEP 453).
  Patch by Donald Stufft and Nick Coghlan.

- Issue #19544 and Issue #6286: Restore use of urllib over http allowing use
  of http_proxy for Distutils upload command, a feature accidentally lost
  in the rollback of distutils2.

- Issue #19544 and Issue #7457: Restore the read_pkg_file method to
  distutils.dist.DistributionMetadata accidentally removed in the undo of
  distutils2.

- Issue #19378: Fixed a number of cases in the dis module where the new
  "file" parameter was not being honoured correctly

- Issue #19378: Removed the "dis.Bytecode.show_info" method

- Issue #19378: Renamed the "dis.Bytecode.display_code" method to
  "dis.Bytecode.dis" and converted it to returning a string rather than
  printing output.

- Issue #19378: the "line_offset" parameter in the new "dis.get_instructions"
  API has been renamed to "first_line" (and the default value and usage
  changed accordingly). This should reduce confusion with the more common use
  of "offset" in the dis docs to refer to bytecode offsets.

- Issue #18678: Corrected spwd struct member names in spwd module:
  sp_nam->sp_namp, and sp_pwd->sp_pwdp.  The old names are kept as extra
  structseq members, for backward compatibility.

- Issue #6157: Fixed tkinter.Text.debug().  tkinter.Text.bbox() now raises

  in bin directories for all configurations: non-framework vs framework,
  and single arch vs universal builds.  pythonx.y-32 is now always
  installed for 64-bit/32-bit universal builds.  The obsolete and
  undocumented pythonw* symlinks are no longer installed anywhere.

- Issue #19553: PEP 453 - "make install" and "make altinstall" now install or
  upgrade pip by default, using the bundled pip provided by the new ensurepip
  module.  A new configure option, --with-ensurepip[=upgrade|install|no], is

What's New in Python 3.4.0 Alpha 4?
===================================

Release date: 2013-10-20

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #19301: Give classes and functions that are explicitly marked global a
  global qualname.

- Issue #19279: UTF-7 decoder no longer produces illegal strings.

- Issue #16612: Add "Argument Clinic", a compile-time preprocessor for
  C files to generate argument parsing code.  (See PEP 436.)

- Issue #18810: Shift stat calls in importlib.machinery.FileFinder such that
  the code is optimistic that if something exists in a directory named exactly
  like the possible package being searched for that it's in actuality a
  directory.

- Issue #18416: importlib.machinery.PathFinder now treats '' as the cwd and
  importlib.machinery.FileFinder no longer special-cases '' to '.'. This leads
  to modules imported from cwd to now possess an absolute file path for
  __file__ (this does not affect modules specified by path on the CLI but it
  does affect -m/runpy). It also allows FileFinder to be more consistent by not
  having an edge case.

- Issue #4555: All exported C symbols are now prefixed with either
  "Py" or "_Py".

- Issue #19219: Speed up marshal.loads(), and make pyc files slightly
  (5% to 10%) smaller.

- Issue #19221: Upgrade Unicode database to version 6.3.0.

- Issue #16742: The result of the C callback PyOS_ReadlineFunctionPointer must
  now be a string allocated by PyMem_RawMalloc() or PyMem_RawRealloc() (or NULL
  if an error occurred), instead of a string allocated by PyMem_Malloc() or
  PyMem_Realloc().

- Issue #19199: Remove ``PyThreadState.tick_counter`` field

- Fix macro expansion of _PyErr_OCCURRED(), and make sure to use it in at
  least one place so as to avoid regressions.

  in Python 3.4.

- Issue #19276: Fixed the wave module on 64-bit big-endian platforms.

- Issue #19266: Rename the new-in-3.4 ``contextlib.ignore`` context manager

  by adding new classes EmailMessage, MIMEPart, and ContentManager.

- Issue #18281: Unused stat constants removed from `tarfile`.

- Issue #18999: Multiprocessing now supports 'contexts' with the same API
  as the module, but bound to specified start methods.

- Issue #18468: The re.split, re.findall, and re.sub functions and the group()
  and groups() methods of match object now always return a string or a bytes
  object.

  to speed up interpreter start.

- Issue #9548: Add a minimal "_bootlocale" module that is imported by the

  longer shadows the print function.

- Issue #19158:  a rare race in BoundedSemaphore could allow .release() too
  often.

- Issue #18716: Deprecate the formatter module.

- Issue #10712: 2to3 has a new "asserts" fixer that replaces deprecated names
  of unittest methods (e.g. failUnlessEqual -> assertEqual).

- Issue #18037: 2to3 now escapes '\u' and '\U' in native strings.

- Issue #17839: base64.decodebytes and base64.encodebytes now accept any
  object that exports a 1 dimensional array of bytes (this means the same
  is now also true for base64_codec)

- Issue #19132: The pprint module now supports compact mode.

- Issue #19137: The pprint module now correctly formats instances of set and
  frozenset subclasses.

- Issue #15663: Update OS X 10.6+ installer to use Tcl/Tk 8.5.15.

- Issue #14499: Fix several problems with OS X universal build support:
    1. ppc arch detection for extension module builds broke with Xcode 5
    2. ppc arch detection in configure did not work on OS X 10.4
    3. -sysroot and -arch flags were unnecessarily duplicated
    4. there was no obvious way to configure an intel-32 only build.

- Issue #19019: Change the OS X installer build script to use CFLAGS instead
  of OPT for special build options.  By setting OPT, some compiler-specific
  options like -fwrapv were overridden and thus not used, which could result
  in broken interpreters when building with clang.

  before moving them into place, to avoid race conditions with other programs
  that may be accessing the maildir directory.

- Issue #14984: On POSIX systems, when netrc is called without a filename
  argument (and therefore is reading the user's $HOME/.netrc file), it now

  objects.

- Issue #17119: Fixed integer overflows when processing large strings and tuples
  in the tkinter module.

  shipped in OS X 10.6 and later releases.

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #18922: Now The Lib/smtpd.py and Tools/i18n/msgfmt.py scripts write

  values, by using `Py_uintptr_t` instead of `size_t`.  Patch by Serhiy
  Storchaka.
