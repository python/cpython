What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: XX-XXX-2008*

Core and builtins
-----------------

- Patch #2426: Added sqlite3.Connection.iterdump method to allow easy dumping
  of databases.  Contributed by Paul Kippes at PyCon 2008.

- Patch #2477: Added from __future__ import unicode_literals.

- Added backport of bytearray type.

- Issue #2355: add Py3k warning for buffer().

- Issue #1477: With narrow Unicode builds, the unicode escape sequence
  \Uxxxxxxxx did not accept values outside the Basic Multilingual Plane.  This
  affected raw unicode literals and the 'raw-unicode-escape' codec.  Now
  UTF-16 surrogates are generated in this case, like normal unicode literals
  and the 'unicode-escape' codec.

- Issue #2348: add Py3k warning for file.softspace.

- Issue #2346/#2347: add Py3k warnings for __methods__ and __members__.

- Issue #2358: Add a Py3k warning on sys.exc_clear() usage.

- Issue #2400: Allow relative imports to "import *".

- Issue 1745.  Backport print function with:
   from __future__ import print_function

- Issue 2332: add new attribute names for instance method objects.
  The two changes are:  im_self -> __self__ and im_func -> __func__

- Issue 2379: Raise a Py3K warning for __getitem__ or __getslice__ on
  exception instances.

- Issue #2371: Add a Py3k warning when catching an exception that
  doesn't derive from BaseException.  Issue #2341: Add a Py3k warning
  when raising an exception that doesn't derive from BaseException.

- Issue #2321: use pymalloc for unicode object string data to reduce
  memory usage in some circumstances.

- PEP 3127: octal literals now start with "0o". Old-style octal literals
  are still valid. There are binary literals with a prefix of "0b".
  This also affects int(x, 0).

- Issue #2359: Adding deprecation warnings for array.{read,write}.

- Issue #1779871: Gnu gcc can now build Python on OS X because the
  flags -Wno-long-double, -no-cpp-precomp, and -mno-fused-madd are no
  longer passed.

- Add a warning when asserting a non-empty tuple which is always true.

- Issue #2179: speed up with statement execution by storing the exit method
  on the stack instead of in a temporary variable (patch by Jeffrey Yaskin)

- Issue #2238: Some syntax errors in *args and **kwargs expressions could give
  bogus error messages.

- Issue #2143: Fix embedded readline() hang on SSL socket EOF.

Extensions Modules
------------------

- Patch #2240: Implement signal.setitimer and signal.getitimer.

Library
-------

- Issue #2495: tokenize.untokenize now inserts a space between two consecutive
  string literals; previously, ["" ""] was rendered as [""""], which is
  incorrect python code.

- Issue #2248: return the result of the QUIT command. from SMTP.quit().

- Backport of Python 3.0's io module.

- Issue #2482: Make sure that the coefficient of a Decimal is always
  stored as a str instance, not as a unicode instance.  This ensures
  that str(Decimal) is always an instance of str.

- Issue #2478: fix failure of decimal.Decimal(0).sqrt()

- Issue #2432: give DictReader the dialect and line_num attributes
  advertised in the docs.

- Issue #2460:  Make Ellipsis object copyable.

- Issue #1681432:  Add triangular distribution to the random module

- Issue #2136: urllib2's auth handler now allows single-quoted realms in the
  WWW-Authenticate header.

- Issue #2434: Enhanced platform.win32_ver() to also work on Python
  installation which do not have the win32all package installed.

- Added support to platform.uname() to also report the machine
  and processor information on Windows XP and later. As a result,
  platform.machine() and platform.processor() will report this
  information as well.

- The library implementing the 2to3 conversion, lib2to3, was added
  to the standard distribution.

- Issue #1747858: Fix chown to work with large uid's and gid's on 64-bit
  platforms.

- Issue #1202: zlib.crc32 and zlib.adler32 no longer return different values
  on 32-bit vs. 64-bit python interpreters.  Both were correct, but they now
  both return a signed integer object for consistency.

- Issue #1158: add %f format (fractions of a second represented as
  microseconds) to datetime objects.  Understood by both strptime and
  strftime.

- Issue #705836: struct.pack(">f", x) now raises OverflowError on all
  platforms when x is too large to fit into an IEEE 754 float; previously
  it only raised OverflowError on non IEEE 754 platforms.

- Issue #1106316: pdb.post_mortem()'s parameter, "traceback", is now
  optional: it defaults to the traceback of the exception that is currently
  being handled (is mandatory to be in the middle of an exception, otherwise
  it raises ValueError).

- Issue #1193577: A .shutdown() method has been added to SocketServers
  which terminates the .serve_forever() loop.

- Bug #2220: handle rlcompleter attribute match failure more gracefully.

- Issue #2225: py_compile, when executed as a script, now returns a non-
  zero status code if not all files could be compiled successfully.

- Bug #1725737: In distutil's sdist, exclude RCS, CVS etc. also in the
  root directory, and also exclude .hg, .git, .bzr, and _darcs.

- Issue #1872: The struct module typecode for _Bool has been changed
  from 't' to '?'.

- The bundled libffi copy is now in sync with the recently released
  libffi3.0.4 version, apart from some small changes to
  Modules/_ctypes/libffi/configure.ac.
  On OS X, preconfigured libffi files are used.
  On all linux systems the --with-system-ffi configure option defaults
  to "yes".

- Issue 1577: shutil.move() now calls os.rename() if the destination is a
  directory instead of copying-then-remove-source.

Tests
-----

- test_nis no longer fails when test.test_support.verbose is true and NIS is
  not set up on the testing machine.

- Output comparison tests are no longer supported.

- Rewrite test_errno to use unittest and no longer be a no-op.

- GHOP 234: Convert test_extcall to doctest.

- GHOP 290: Convert test_dbm and test_dummy_threading to unittest.

- GHOP 293: Convert test_strftime, test_getargs, and test_pep247 to unittest.

- Issue #2055: Convert test_fcntl to unittest.

- Issue 1960: Convert test_gdbm to unittest.

- GHOP 294: Convert test_contains, test_crypt, and test_select to unittest.

- GHOP 238: Convert test_tokenize to use doctest.

- GHOP 237: Rewrite test_thread using unittest.

- Patch #2232: os.tmpfile might fail on Windows if the user has no
  permission to create files in the root directory.

Build
-----

- A new script 2to3 is now installed, to run the 2.x to 3.x converter.

- Python/memmove.c and Python/strerror.c have been removed; both functions are
  in the C89 standard library.

- Patch #2284: Add -x64 option to rt.bat.

C API
-----

- Patch #2477: Added PyParser_ParseFileFlagsEx() and 
  PyParser_ParseStringFlagsFilenameEx()

What's New in Python 2.6 alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: 29-Feb-2008*

Core and builtins
-----------------

- Issue #2051: pyc and pyo files are no longer created with permission
  644. The mode is now inherited from the py file.

- Issue #2067: file.__exit__() now calls subclasses' close() method.

- Patch #1759: Backport of PEP 3129 class decorators.

- Issue #1881: An internal parser limit has been increased. Also see 
  issue 215555 for a discussion.

- Added the future_builtins module, which contains hex() and oct().
  These are the PEP 3127 version of these functions, designed to be
  compatible with the hex() and oct() builtins from Python 3.0.  They
  differ slightly in their output formats from the existing, unchanged
  Python 2.6 builtins.  The expected usage of the future_builtins
  module is:
    from future_builtins import hex, oct

- Issue #1600: Modifed PyOS_ascii_formatd to use at most 2 digit
  exponents for exponents with absolute value < 100.  Follows C99
  standard.  This is a change on Windows, which would use 3 digits.
  Also, added 'n' to the formats that PyOS_ascii_formatd understands,
  so that any alterations it does to the resulting string will be
  available in stringlib/formatter.h (for float.__format__).

- Implemented PEP 3101, Advanced String Formatting.  This adds a new
  builtin format(); a format() method for str and unicode; a
  __format__() method to object, str, unicode, int, long, float, and
  datetime; the class string.Formatter; and the C API
  PyObject_Format().

- Fixed several potential crashes, all caused by specially crafted __del__
  methods exploiting objects in temporarily inconsistent state.

- Issue #2115: Important speedup in setting __slot__ attributes.  Also 
  prevent a possible crash: an Abstract Base Class would try to access a slot 
  on a registered virtual subclass.

- Fixed repr() and str() of complex numbers with infinity or nan as real or
  imaginary part.

- Clear all free lists during a gc.collect() of the highest generation in order
  to allow pymalloc to free more arenas. Python may give back memory to the
  OS earlier.

- Issue #2045: Fix an infinite recursion triggered when printing a subclass of
  collections.defaultdict, if its default_factory is set to a bound method.

- Fixed a minor memory leak in dictobject.c. The content of the free
  list was not freed on interpreter shutdown.

- Limit free list of method and builtin function objects to 256 entries
  each.

- Patch #1953: Added ``sys._compact_freelists()`` and the C API functions
  ``PyInt_CompactFreeList`` and ``PyFloat_CompactFreeList``
  to compact the internal free lists of pre-allocted ints and floats.

- Bug #1983: Fixed return type of fork(), fork1() and forkpty() calls.
  Python expected the return type int but the fork familie returns pi_t.

- Issue #1678380: Fix a bug that identifies 0j and -0j when they appear
  in the same code unit.

- Issue #2025 :  Add tuple.count() and tuple.index() methods to comply with
  the collections.Sequence API.

- Patch #1970 by Antoine Pitrou: Speedup unicode whitespace and linebreak
  detection

- Added ``PyType_ClearCache()`` and ``sys._clear_type_cache`` to clear the
  internal lookup cache for ref leak tests.

- Patch #1473257: generator objects gain a gi_code attribute. This is the
  same object as the func_code attribute of the function that produced the
  generator.

- Issue #1920: "while 0" statements were completely removed by the compiler,
  even in the presence of an "else" clause, which is supposed to be run when 
  the condition is false. Now the compiler correctly emits bytecode for the
  "else" suite.

- A few crashers fixed: weakref_in_del.py (issue #1377858);
  loosing_dict_ref.py (issue #1303614, test67.py);
  borrowed_ref_[34].py (not in tracker).

- Issue #1069410: The "can't load dll" message box on Windows is
  suppressed while an extension is loaded by calling SetErrorMode in
  dynload_win.c. The error is still reported properly.

- Bug #1915: Python compiles with --enable-unicode=no again. However
  several extension methods and modules do not work without unicode
  support.

- Issue #1882: when compiling code from a string, encoding cookies in the
  second line of code were not always recognized correctly.

- Issue #1679: "0x" was taken as a valid integer literal.

- Issue #1865: ``bytes`` as an alias for ``str`` and b"" as an alias "" were
  added.

- sys.float_info / PyFloat_GetInfo: The floating point information
  object was converted from a dict to a specialized structseq object.

- Patch #1816: Added sys.flags structseq. It exposes the status of most
  command line arguments and PYTHON* environment variables.

- Objects/structseq.c: Implemented new structseq representation. The patch
  makes structseqs (e.g. the return value of os.stat) more readable.

- Patch #1700288: added a type attribute cache that caches method accesses,
  resulting in speedups in heavily object-oriented code.

- Bug #1776: __import__() no longer accepts filenames on any platform.
  The first parameter to __import__() must be a valid module name.

- Patch #1668: renamed THREADDEBUG envvar to PYTHONTHREADDEBUG.

- Patch #602345: Add -B command line option, PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE envvar
  and sys.dont_write_bytecode attribute. All these can be set to forbid Python
  to attempt to write compiled bytecode files.

- Improve some exception messages when Windows fails to load an extension
  module. Now we get for example '%1 is not a valid Win32 application' instead
  of 'error code 193'.

- Bug #1481296: Fixed long(float('nan'))!=0L.

- Issue #1640: Added math.isinf(x), math.isnan(x) and math.copysign(x, y)
  functions.

- Issue #1635: Platform independent creation and representation of NaN
  and INF. float("nan"), float("inf") and float("-inf") now work on every
  platform with IEEE 754 semantics.

- Compiler now generates simpler and faster code for dictionary literals.
  The oparg for BUILD_MAP now indicates an estimated dictionary size.
  There is a new opcode, STORE_MAP, for adding entries to the dictionary.

- Issue #1638: %zd configure test fails on Linux

- Issue #1620: New property decorator syntax was modifying the decorator
  in place instead of creating a new decorator object.

- Issue #1538: Avoid copying string in split/rsplit if the split
  char is not found.

- Issue #1553: An erroneous __length_hint__ can make list() raise a
  SystemError.

- PEP 366: Allow explicit relative imports when executing modules
  inside packages with the -m switch via a new module level
  __package__ attribute.

- Issue #1402: Fix a crash on exit, when another thread is still running, and
  if the deallocation of its frames somehow calls the PyGILState_Ensure() /
  PyGILState_Release() functions.

- Expose the Py_Py3kWarningFlag as sys.py3kwarning.

- Issue #1445: Fix a SystemError when accessing the ``cell_contents``
  attribute of an empty cell object.

- Issue #1460: The utf-7 incremental decoder did not accept truncated input.
  It now correctly saves its state between chunks of data.

- Patch #1739468: Directories and zipfiles containing a __main__.py file can
  now be directly executed by passing their name to the interpreter. The
  directory/zipfile is automatically inserted as the first entry in sys.path.

- Issue #1265: Fix a problem with sys.settrace, if the tracing function uses a
  generator expression when at the same time the executed code is closing a
  paused generator.

- sets and frozensets now have an isdisjoint() method.

- optimize the performance of builtin.sum().

- Fix warnings found by the new version of the Coverity checker.

- The enumerate() builtin function is no longer bounded to sequences smaller
  than LONG_MAX.  Formerly, it raised an OverflowError.  Now, automatically
  shifts from ints to longs.

- Issue #1686386: Tuple's tp_repr did not take into account the possibility of
  having a self-referential tuple, which is possible from C code.  Nor did
  object's tp_str consider that a type's tp_str could do something that could
  lead to an inifinite recursion.  Py_ReprEnter() and Py_EnterRecursiveCall(),
  respectively, fixed the issues.

- Issue #1164: It was possible to trigger deadlock when using the 'print'
  statement to write to a file since the GIL was not released as needed.  Now
  PyObject_Print() does the right thing along with various tp_print
  implementations of the built-in types and those in the collections module.

- Issue #1147: Exceptions were directly allowing string exceptions in their
  throw() method even though string exceptions no longer allowed.

- Issue #1096: Prevent a segfault from getting the repr of a very deeply nested
  list by using the recursion counter.

- Issue #1202533: Fix infinite recursion calls triggered by calls to
  PyObject_Call() never calling back out to Python code to trigger recursion
  depth updates/checks.  Required the creation of a static RuntimeError
  instance in case normalizing an exception put the recursion check value past
  its limit.  Fixes crashers infinite_rec_(1|2|4|5).py.

- Patch #1031213: Decode source line in SyntaxErrors back to its original source
  encoding.

- Patch #1673759: add a missing overflow check when formatting floats
  with %G.

- Prevent expandtabs() on string and unicode objects from causing a segfault
  when a large width is passed on 32-bit platforms.

- Bug #1733488: Fix compilation of bufferobject.c on AIX.

- Bug #1722485: remove docstrings again when running with -OO.

- Add new attribute names for function objects.  All the func_* become
  __*__ attributes.  (Some already existed, e.g., __doc__ and __name__.)

- Add -3 option to the interpreter to warn about features that are
  deprecated and will be changed/removed in Python 3.0.

- Patch #1686487: you can now pass any mapping after '**' in function
  calls.

- except clauses may now be spelled either "except E, target:" or
  "except E as target:". This is to provide forwards compatibility with
  Python 3.0.

- Deprecate BaseException.message as per PEP 352.

- Bug #1303614: don't expose object's __dict__ when the dict is
  inherited from a builtin base.

- When __slots__ are set to a unicode string, make it work the same as
  setting a plain string, ie don't expand to single letter identifiers.

- Request #1191699:  Slices can now be pickled.

- Request #1193128:  str.translate() now allows a None argument for
  translations that only remove characters without re-mapping the
  remaining characters.

- Patch #1682205: a TypeError while unpacking an iterable is no longer
  masked by a generic one with the message "unpack non-sequence".

- Remove unused file Python/fmod.c.

- Bug #1683368: The object.__init__() and object.__new__() methods are
  now stricter in rejecting excess arguments.  The only time when
  either allows excess arguments is when it is not overridden and the
  other one is.  For backwards compatibility, when both are
  overridden, it is a deprecation warning (for now; maybe a Py3k
  warning later).  Also, type.__init__() insists on the same signature
  as supported by type.__new__().

- Patch #1675423: PyComplex_AsCComplex() now tries to convert an object
  to complex using its __complex__() method before falling back to the
  __float__() method. Therefore, the functions in the cmath module now
  can operate on objects that define a __complex__() method.

- Patch #1623563: allow __class__ assignment for classes with __slots__.
  The old and the new class are still required to have the same slot names.

- Patch #1642547: Fix an error/crash when encountering syntax errors in
  complex if statements.

- Patch #1462488: Python no longer segfaults when ``object.__reduce_ex__()``
  is called with an object that is faking its type.

- Patch #1680015: Don't modify __slots__ tuple if it contains an unicode
  name.

- Patch #1444529: the builtin compile() now accepts keyword arguments.

- Bug #1678647: write a newline after printing an exception in any
  case, even when converting the value to a string failed.

- The dir() function has been extended to call the __dir__() method on
  its argument, if it exists. If not, it will work like before. This allows
  customizing the output of dir() in the presence of a __getattr__().

- Patch #922167: Python no longer segfaults when faced with infinitely
  self-recursive reload() calls (as reported by bug #742342).

- Patch #1675981: remove unreachable code from ``type.__new__()`` method.

- Patch #1491866: change the complex() constructor to allow parthensized
  forms. This means complex(repr(x)) now works instead of raising a
  ValueError.

- Patch #703779: unset __file__ in __main__ after running a file. This
  makes the filenames the warning module prints much more sensible when
  a PYTHONSTARTUP file is used.

- Variant of patch #697613: don't exit the interpreter on a SystemExit
  exception if the -i command line option or PYTHONINSPECT environment
  variable is given, but break into the interactive interpreter just like
  on other exceptions or normal program exit.

- Patch #1638879: don't accept strings with embedded NUL bytes in long().

- Bug #1674503: close the file opened by execfile() in an error condition.

- Patch #1674228: when assigning a slice (old-style), check for the
  sq_ass_slice instead of the sq_slice slot.

- When printing an unraisable error, don't print exceptions. before the name.
  This duplicates the behavior whening normally printing exceptions.

- Bug #1653736: Properly discard third argument to slot_nb_inplace_power.

- PEP 352: Raising a string exception now triggers a TypeError.  Attempting to
  catch a string exception raises DeprecationWarning.

- Bug #1377858: Fix the segfaulting of the interpreter when an object created
  a weakref on itself during a __del__ call for new-style classes (classic
  classes still have the bug).

- Bug #1579370: Make PyTraceBack_Here use the current thread, not the
  frame's thread state.

- patch #1630975: Fix crash when replacing sys.stdout in sitecustomize.py

- Prevent seg fault on shutdown which could occur if an object
  raised a warning.

- Bug #1566280: Explicitly invoke threading._shutdown from Py_Main,
  to avoid relying on atexit.

- Bug #1590891: random.randrange don't return correct value for big number

- Patch #1586791: Better exception messages for some operations on strings,
  tuples and lists.

- Bug #1067760: Deprecate passing floats to file.seek.

- Bug #1591996: Correctly forward exception in instance_contains().

- Bug #1588287: fix invalid assertion for `1,2` in debug builds.

- Bug #1576657: when setting a KeyError for a tuple key, make sure that
  the tuple isn't used as the "exception arguments tuple".

- Bug #1565514, SystemError not raised on too many nested blocks.

- Bug #1576174: WindowsError now displays the windows error code
  again, no longer the posix error code.

- Patch #1549049: Support long values in structmember, issue warnings
  if the assigned value for structmember fields gets truncated.

- Update the peephole optimizer to remove more dead code (jumps after returns)
  and inline unconditional jumps to returns.

- Bug #1545497: when given an explicit base, int() did ignore NULs
  embedded in the string to convert.

- Bug #1569998: break inside a try statement (outside a loop) is now
  recognized and rejected.

- list.pop(x) accepts any object x following the __index__ protocol.

- A number of places, including integer negation and absolute value,
  were fixed to not rely on undefined behaviour of the C compiler
  anymore.

- Bug #1566800: make sure that EnvironmentError can be called with any
  number of arguments, as was the case in Python 2.4.

- Patch #1567691: super() and new.instancemethod() now don't accept
  keyword arguments any more (previously they accepted them, but didn't
  use them).

- Fix a bug in the parser's future statement handling that led to "with"
  not being recognized as a keyword after, e.g., this statement:
  from __future__ import division, with_statement

- Bug #1557232: fix seg fault with def f((((x)))) and def f(((x),)).

- Fix %zd string formatting on Mac OS X so it prints negative numbers.

- Allow exception instances to be directly sliced again.

- Bug #1551432: Exceptions do not define an explicit __unicode__ method.  This
  allows calling unicode() on exceptions classes directly to succeed.

- Bug #1542051: Exceptions now correctly call PyObject_GC_UnTrack.
  Also make sure that every exception class has __module__ set to
  'exceptions'.

- Bug #1550983: emit better error messages for erroneous relative
  imports (if not in package and if beyond toplevel package).

- Overflow checking code in integer division ran afoul of new gcc
  optimizations.  Changed to be more standard-conforming.

- Patch #1542451: disallow continue anywhere under a finally.

- Patch #1546288: fix seg fault in dict_equal due to ref counting bug.

- The return tuple from str.rpartition(sep) is (tail, sep, head) where
  head is the original string if sep was not found.

- Bug #1520864: unpacking singleton tuples in list comprehensions and
  generator expressions (x for x, in ... ) works again.  Fixing this problem
  required changing the .pyc magic number.  This means that .pyc files
  generated before 2.5c2 will be regenerated.

- ``with`` and ``as`` are now keywords.

- Bug #1664966: Fix crash in exec if Unicode filename can't be decoded.

- Issue #1537: Changed GeneratorExit's base class from Exception to
  BaseException.

- Fix Issue #1703448: A joined thread could show up in the
  threading.enumerate() list after the join() for a brief period until
  it actually exited.


Library
-------

- #2274 Add heapq.heappushpop().

- Add inspect.isabstract(object) to fix bug #2223

- Add a __format__ method to Decimal, to support PEP 3101.

- Add a timing parameter when using trace.Trace to print out timestamps.

- #1627: httplib now ignores negative Content-Length headers.

- #900744: If an invalid chunked-encoding header is sent by a server,
  httplib will now raise IncompleteRead and close the connection instead
  of raising ValueError.

- #1492: The content type of BaseHTTPServer error messages can now be
  overridden.

- Issue 1781: ConfigParser now does not let you add the "default" section
  (ignore-case)

- Removed uses of dict.has_key() from distutils, and uses of
  callable() from copy_reg.py, so the interpreter now starts up
  without warnings when '-3' is given.  More work like this needs to
  be done in the rest of the stdlib.

- Issue #1916. Added isgenerator() and isgeneratorfunction() to inspect.py.

- #1224: Fixed bad url parsing when path begins with double slash.

- ctypes instances that are not or do not contain pointers can now be
  pickled.

- Patch #1966: Break infinite loop in httplib when the servers
  implements the chunked encoding incorrectly.

- Rename rational.py to fractions.py and the rational.Rational class
  to fractions.Fraction, to avoid the name clash with the abstract
  base class numbers.Rational.  See discussion in issue #1682.

- The pickletools module now provides an optimize() function
  that eliminates unused PUT opcodes from a pickle string.

- #2021: Allow tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile and SpooledTemporaryFile
  to be used in with statements by correctly supporting the context
  management protocol.

- #1979: Add rich comparisons to Decimal, and make Decimal comparisons
  involving a NaN follow the IEEE 754 standard.

- #2004: tarfile.py: Use mode 0700 for temporary directories and default
  permissions for missing directories.

  after the first iteration. Now it correctly steps on the expression, and
  breakpoints on the "while" statement are honored on each loop.

- #1765140: add an optional delay argument to FileHandler and its
  subclasses. Defaults to false (existing behaviour), but if true,
  defers opening the file until the first call to emit().

- The pprint module now supports sets and frozensets.

- #1221598: add optional callbacks to ftplib.FTP's storbinary() and

  time so that opening a database previously created with the DB_DUP or
  DB_DUPSORT flag set will keep the proper behavior on subsequent opens.
  Specifically: dictionary assignment to a DB object will replace all
  values for a given key when the database allows duplicate values.
  DB users should use DB.put(k, v) when they want to store duplicates; not
  DB[k] = v.

- Add the bsddb.db.DBEnv.lock_id_free method.

- Bug #1686475: Support stat'ing open files on Windows again.

    codepoints now.

- Bug #1552726: in readline.c, avoid repeatedly polling in interactive
  mode by only placing a timeout on the select() if an input hook has

Tests
-----

- Refactor test_logging to use unittest.

- Refactor test_profile and test_cprofile to use the same code to profile.

- Make test_runpy reentrant by fixing _check_module to clear out any module
  being tested.  Was causing an error by __import__ doing a reload on the
  second run and thus suppressing bytecode recreation.

- Capture socket connection resets and timeouts in test_socket_ssl and
  test_urllib2net and raise test.test_support.ResourceDenied.

- Patch #1559413: Fix test_cmd_line if sys.executable contains a space.

  surround calls to resources that are not guaranteed to work even if
  test.test_support.requires says that the resource should exist.

- Added a test for slicing of an exception.

- Added test.test_support.EnvironmentVarGuard.  It's a class that provides a
  context manager so that one can temporarily set or unset environment
  variables.

- Added some tests for modulefinder.

- Converted test_imp to use unittest.

- Fix bsddb test_basics.test06_Transactions to check the version
  number properly.

- test.test_support.catch_warning is a new context manager that can be used
  to catch the warnings issued by the warning framework.


Tools
-----

- Tools/scripts/reindent.py now creates the backup file using shutil.copy
  to preserve user/group and permissions. Added also a --nobackup option
  to not create the backup if the user is concerned regarding this.  Check
  issue 1050828 for more details.

- Tools/scripts/win_add2path.py was added. The simple script modifes the
  PATH environment var of the HKCU tree and adds the python bin and script
  directory.

- Tools/18n/pygettext.py was added to the list of scripts installed by
  Tools/scripts/setup.py (tracker item 642309).

  was patch #1563844)

- Made some minor changes to pybench output to allow the user
  to see which Python version is running pybench

- Added support for the new platform module feature
  platform.python_implementation(); this will now be saved
  in the benchmark pickle

- Bug #1608: use -fwrapv when GCC supports it.  This is important,
  newer GCC versions may optimize away overflow buffer overflow checks
  without this option!

- Add a FAST_LOOPS build option that speeds-up looping by trading away
  periodic threadstate and signal checking in tight loops.  By default,

C API
-----

- Unified naming convention for free lists and their limits. All free lists
  in Object/ are named ``free_list``, the counter ``numfree`` and the upper
  limit is a macro ``PyName_MAXFREELIST`` inside an #ifndef block.

- ``PySet_Add()`` can now modify a newly created frozenset.  Similarly to
  ``PyTuple_SetItem``, it can be used to populate a brand new frozenset; but 
  it does not steal a reference to the added item.

- Added ``PySet_Check()`` and ``PyFrozenSet_Check()`` to the set API. 

- Backport of PyUnicode_FromString(), _FromStringAndSize(), _Format and
  _FormatV from Python 3.0. Made PyLong_AsSsize_t and PyLong_FromSsize_t
  public functions.

- Patch #1720595: add T_BOOL to the range of structmember types.

- Issue #1534: Added ``PyFloat_GetMax()``, ``PyFloat_GetMin()`` and
  ``PyFloat_GetInfo()`` to the float API.

- Issue #1521: On 64bit platforms, using PyArgs_ParseTuple with the t# of w#
  format code incorrectly truncated the length to an int, even when
  PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN is set.  The str.decode method used to return incorrect
  results with huge strings.

- Issue #1629: Renamed Py_Size, Py_Type and Py_Refcnt to Py_SIZE, Py_TYPE
  and Py_REFCNT.

- PEP 3123: Provide forward compatibility with Python 3.0, while keeping
  backwards compatibility. Add Py_Refcnt, Py_Type, Py_Size, and
  PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT.

- Py_ssize_t fields work in structmember when HAVE_LONG_LONG is not defined.

- Patch #1733960: Allow T_LONGLONG to accept ints.

- T_PYSSIZET can now be used in PyMemberDef lists for Py_ssize_t members.

- Added a new API function ``PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock``.

- Bug #1637022: Prefix AST symbols with _Py_.

- Fix some leftovers from the conversion from int to Py_ssize_t
  (relevant to strings and sequences of more than 2**31 items).

- Make _PyGILState_NoteThreadState() static, it was not used anywhere
  outside of pystate.c and should not be necessary.

- ``PyImport_Import`` and ``PyImport_ImportModule`` now always do absolute
  imports. In earlier versions they might have used relative imports under
  some conditions.

- Added case insensitive comparison methods ``PyOS_stricmp(char*, char*)``
  and ``PyOS_strnicmp(char*, char*, Py_ssize_t)``.

- Bug #1542693: remove semi-colon at end of PyImport_ImportModuleEx macro
  so it can be used as an expression.


Windows
-------

- Patch #1706: Drop support for Win9x, WinME and NT4. Python now requires 
  Windows 2000 or greater. The _WINVER and NTDDI_VERSION macros are set to
  Win2k for x86/32bit builds and WinXP for AMD64 builds.

- Conditionalize definition of _CRT_SECURE_NO_DEPRECATE
  and _CRT_NONSTDC_NO_DEPRECATE.

- Bug #1216: Restore support for Visual Studio 2002.


Mac
---

- cfmfile now raises a DeprecationWarning.

- buildtools now raises a DeprecationWarning.

- Removed the macfs module.  It had been deprecated since Python 2.5.  This
  lead to the deprecation of macostools.touched() as it relied solely on macfs
  and was a no-op under OS X.
