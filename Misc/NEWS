  with size >= 2**31), instead of producing illegal marshal data.

- Issue #12983: Bytes literals with invalid \x escape now raise a SyntaxError
  and a full traceback including line number.

- Issue #16967: In function definition, evaluate positional defaults before
  keyword-only defaults.

  bootstrapping of importlib.

- Issue #16979: Fix error handling bugs in the unicode-escape-decode decoder.

- Issue #16772: The base argument to the int constructor no longer accepts
  floats, or other non-integer objects with an __int__ method.  Objects
  with an __index__ method are now accepted.

- Issue #10156: In the interpreter's initialization phase, unicode globals
  are now initialized dynamically as needed.

- Issue #16980: Fix processing of escaped non-ascii bytes in the
  unicode-escape-decode decoder.

- Issue #16975: Fix error handling bug in the escape-decode bytes decoder.

- Issue #14850: Now a charmap decoder treats U+FFFE as "undefined mapping"
  in any mapping, not only in a string.

- Issue #16730: importlib.machinery.FileFinder now no longers raises an
  exception when trying to populate its cache and it finds out the directory is
  unreadable or has turned into a file. Reported and diagnosed by
  David Pritchard.

- Issue #16906: Fix a logic error that prevented most static strings from being
  cleared.

- Issue #11461: Fix the incremental UTF-16 decoder. Original patch by
  Amaury Forgeot d'Arc.

- Issue #16761: Calling int() with base argument only now raises TypeError.

- Issue #16759: Support the full DWORD (unsigned long) range in Reg2Py
  when retrieving a REG_DWORD value. This corrects functions like
  winreg.QueryValueEx that may have been returning truncated values.

- Issue #14420: Support the full DWORD (unsigned long) range in Py2Reg
  when passed a REG_DWORD value. Fixes OverflowError in winreg.SetValueEx.

  take advantage of the os.path.samefile/sameopenfile/samestat implementations
  used by other platforms.

- Issue #16772: The int() constructor's second argument (base) no longer
  accepts non integer values.  Consistent with the behavior in Python 2.

- Issue #15422: Get rid of PyCFunction_New macro. Use PyCFunction_NewEx
  function (PyCFunction_New func is still present for backward compatibility).

- Issue #14470: Remove w9xpopen support per PEP 11.

  handled correctly (previously, the first module loaded from that file
  was silently returned). Patch by Václav Šmilauer.

  chain, the object could remain reachable through its weakref even though
  its refcount had dropped to zero.

- Issue #16619: Create NameConstant AST class to represent None, True, and False
  literals. As a result, these constants are never loaded at runtime from
  builtins.

- Issue #16455: On FreeBSD and Solaris, if the locale is C, the
  ASCII/surrogateescape codec is now used, instead of the locale encoding, to
  decode the command line arguments. This change fixes inconsistencies with
  os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() because these operating systems announces an
  ASCII locale encoding, whereas the ISO-8859-1 encoding is used in practice.

- Issue #16290: A float return value from the __complex__ special method is no
  longer accepted in the complex() constructor.

- Issue #16416: On Mac OS X, operating system data are now always
  encoded/decoded to/from UTF-8/surrogateescape, instead of the locale encoding
  (which may be ASCII if no locale environment variable is set), to avoid
  inconsistencies with os.fsencode() and os.fsdecode() functions which are
  already using UTF-8/surrogateescape.

- Issue #16453: Fix equality testing of dead weakref objects.

- Issue #9535: Fix pending signals that have been received but not yet
  handled by Python to not persist after os.fork() in the child process.

  rather than raising OverflowError.

- Issue #15001: fix segfault on "del sys.modules['__main__']". Patch by Victor
  Stinner.

- Issue #8271: the utf-8 decoder now outputs the correct number of U+FFFD
  characters when used with the 'replace' error handler on invalid utf-8
  sequences.  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka, tests by Ezio Melotti.

- Issue #5765: Apply a hard recursion limit in the compiler instead of
  blowing the stack and segfaulting. Initial patch by Andrea Griffini.

  Patch by Alon Horev with update by Alexey Kachayev.

- Issue #16309: Make PYTHONPATH="" behavior the same as if PYTHONPATH
  not set at all.

- Issue #10189: Improve the error reporting of SyntaxErrors related to global
  and nonlocal statements.

- Issue #16086: PyTypeObject.tp_flags and PyType_Spec.flags are now unsigned
  (unsigned long and unsigned int) to avoid an undefined behaviour with
  Py_TPFLAGS_TYPE_SUBCLASS ((1 << 31). PyType_GetFlags() result type is
  now unsigned too (unsigned long, instead of long).

- Fix segfaults on setting __qualname__ on builtin types and attempting to
  delete it on any type.

- Issue #14625: Rewrite the UTF-32 decoder. It is now 3x to 4x faster. Patch
  written by Serhiy Storchaka.

  received a nonempty dict from the constructor.

- Issue #16271: Fix strange bugs that resulted from __qualname__ appearing in a
  class's __dict__ and on type.

  decoder (already working as unicode strings).  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- Issue #15144: Fix possible integer overflow when handling pointers as integer
  values, by using `Py_uintptr_t` instead of `size_t`.  Patch by Serhiy
  Storchaka.

- Issue #15965: Explicitly cast `AT_FDCWD` as (int).  Required on Solaris 10
  (which defines `AT_FDCWD` as ``0xffd19553``), harmless on other platforms.

- Fixes for a few crash and memory leak regressions found by Coverity.

Library
-------

- Issue #15882: Change `_decimal` to accept any coefficient tuple when
  constructing infinities. This is done for backwards compatibility with
  decimal.py: Infinity coefficients are undefined in _decimal (in accordance
  with the specification).

- Issue #15925: Fix a regression in `email.util` where the `parsedate()` and
  `parsedate_tz()` functions did not return None anymore when the argument could

  method.

- Issue #15785: Modify `window.get_wch()` API of the curses module: return a

  returning an integer. So it is now possible to distinguish special keys like
  keypad keys.

- Issue #14223: Fix `window.addch()` of the curses module for special characters
  like curses.ACS_HLINE: the Python function addch(int) and addch(bytes) is now
  calling the C function waddch()/mvwaddch() (as it was done in Python 3.2),
  instead of wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch(). The Python function addch(str) is still
  calling the C function wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch() if the Python curses is linked
  to libncursesw.

Documentation
-------------

- Issue #15081: Document PyState_FindModule.
  Patch by Robin Schreiber.

- Issue #14814: Added first draft of ipaddress module API reference

Tests
-----

- Issue #14769: test_capi now has SkipitemTest, which cleverly checks

Build
-----

- Issue #13590: Improve support for OS X Xcode 4:
    * Try to avoid building Python or extension modules with problematic
      llvm-gcc compiler.
    * Since Xcode 4 removes ppc support, extension module builds now
      check for ppc compiler support and automatically remove ppc and
      ppc64 archs when not available.
    * Since Xcode 4 no longer install SDKs in default locations,
      extension module builds now revert to using installed headers
      and libs if the SDK used to build the interpreter is not
      available.
    * Update ./configure to use better defaults for universal builds;
      in particular, --enable-universalsdk=yes uses the Xcode default
      SDK and --with-universal-archs now defaults to "intel" if ppc
      not available.

- Issue #14225: Fix Unicode support for curses (#12567) on OS X

- Issue #14928: Fix importlib bootstrap issues by using a custom executable

What's New in Python 3.3.0 Alpha 1?
===================================

*Release date: 05-Mar-2012*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #14172: Fix reference leak when marshalling a buffer-like object
  (other than a bytes object).

- Issue #13521: dict.setdefault() now does only one lookup for the given key,
  making it "atomic" for many purposes.  Patch by Filip Gruszczyński.

- PEP 409, Issue #6210: "raise X from None" is now supported as a means of
  suppressing the display of the chained exception context. The chained
  context still remains available as the __context__ attribute.

- Issue #10181: New memoryview implementation fixes multiple ownership
  and lifetime issues of dynamically allocated Py_buffer members (#9990)
  as well as crashes (#8305, #7433). Many new features have been added
  (See whatsnew/3.3), and the documentation has been updated extensively.
  The ndarray test object from _testbuffer.c implements all aspects of
  PEP-3118, so further development towards the complete implementation
  of the PEP can proceed in a test-driven manner.

  Thanks to Nick Coghlan, Antoine Pitrou and Pauli Virtanen for review
  and many ideas.

- Issue #12834: Fix incorrect results of memoryview.tobytes() for
  non-contiguous arrays.

- Issue #5231: Introduce memoryview.cast() method that allows changing
  format and shape without making a copy of the underlying memory.

- Issue #14084: Fix a file descriptor leak when importing a module with a
  bad encoding.

- Upgrade Unicode data to Unicode 6.1.

- Issue #14040: Remove rarely used file name suffixes for C extensions
  (under POSIX mainly).

- Issue #14051: Allow arbitrary attributes to be set of classmethod and
  staticmethod.

- Issue #13703: oCERT-2011-003: Randomize hashes of str and bytes to protect
  against denial of service attacks due to hash collisions within the dict and
  set types.  Patch by David Malcolm, based on work by Victor Stinner.

- Issue #13020: Fix a reference leak when allocating a structsequence object
  fails.  Patch by Suman Saha.

- Issue #13908: Ready types returned from PyType_FromSpec.

- Issue #11235: Fix OverflowError when trying to import a source file whose
  modification time doesn't fit in a 32-bit timestamp.

- Issue #12705: A SyntaxError exception is now raised when attempting to
  compile multiple statements as a single interactive statement.

- Fix the builtin module initialization code to store the init function for
  future reinitialization.

- Issue #8052: The posix subprocess module would take a long time closing
  all possible file descriptors in the child process rather than just open
  file descriptors.  It now closes only the open fds if possible for the
  default close_fds=True behavior.

- Issue #13629: Renumber the tokens in token.h so that they match the indexes
  into _PyParser_TokenNames.

- Issue #13752: Add a casefold() method to str.

- Issue #13761: Add a "flush" keyword argument to the print() function,
  used to ensure flushing the output stream.

- Issue #13645: pyc files now contain the size of the corresponding source
  code, to avoid timestamp collisions (especially on filesystems with a low
  timestamp resolution) when checking for freshness of the bytecode.

- PEP 380, Issue #11682: Add "yield from <x>" to support easy delegation to
  subgenerators (initial patch by Greg Ewing, integration into 3.3 by
  Renaud Blanch, Ryan Kelly, Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek and Nick Coghlan)

- Issue #13748: Raw bytes literals can now be written with the ``rb`` prefix
  as well as ``br``.

- Issue #12736: Use full unicode case mappings for upper, lower, and title case.

- Issue #12760: Add a create mode to open(). Patch by David Townshend.

- Issue #13738: Simplify implementation of bytes.lower() and bytes.upper().

- Issue #13577: Built-in methods and functions now have a __qualname__.
  Patch by sbt.

- Issue #6695: Full garbage collection runs now clear the freelist of set
  objects.  Initial patch by Matthias Troffaes.

- Fix OSError.__init__ and OSError.__new__ so that each of them can be
  overriden and take additional arguments (followup to issue #12555).

- Fix the fix for issue #12149: it was incorrect, although it had the side
  effect of appearing to resolve the issue.  Thanks to Mark Shannon for
  noticing.

- Issue #13505: Pickle bytes objects in a way that is compatible with
  Python 2 when using protocols <= 2.

- Issue #11147: Fix an unused argument in _Py_ANNOTATE_MEMORY_ORDER.  (Fix
  given by Campbell Barton).

  pickle protocol >= 3.  The old reduction format is kept with older protocols
  in order to allow unpickling under Python 2.  Patch by Irmen de Jong.

- Issue #7111: Python can now be run without a stdin, stdout or stderr
  stream.  It was already the case with Python 2.  However, the corresponding
  sys module entries are now set to None (instead of an unusable file object).

- Issue #11849: Ensure that free()d memory arenas are really released
  on POSIX systems supporting anonymous memory mappings.  Patch by
  Charles-François Natali.

- Issue #13452: PyUnicode_EncodeDecimal() doesn't support error handlers
  different than "strict" anymore. The caller was unable to compute the
  size of the output buffer: it depends on the error handler.

- PEP 3155 / issue #13448: Qualified name for classes and functions.

- Issue #13436: Fix a bogus error message when an AST object was passed
  an invalid integer value.

- Issue #13411: memoryview objects are now hashable when the underlying
  object is hashable.

- Issue #13338: Handle all enumerations in _Py_ANNOTATE_MEMORY_ORDER
  to allow compiling extension modules with -Wswitch-enum on gcc.
  Initial patch by Floris Bruynooghe.

- Issue #10227: Add an allocation cache for a single slice object.  Patch by
  Stefan Behnel.

- Issue #13393: BufferedReader.read1() now asks the full requested size to
  the raw stream instead of limiting itself to the buffer size.

- Issue #13392: Writing a pyc file should now be atomic under Windows as well.

- Issue #13333: The UTF-7 decoder now accepts lone surrogates (the encoder
  already accepts them).

- Issue #13389: Full garbage collection passes now clear the freelists for
  list and dict objects.  They already cleared other freelists in the
  interpreter.

- Issue #13327: Remove the need for an explicit None as the second argument
  to os.utime, os.lutimes, os.futimes, os.futimens, os.futimesat, in
  order to update to the current time. Also added keyword argument
  handling to os.utimensat in order to remove the need for explicit None.

- Issue #13350: Simplify some C code by replacing most usages of
  PyUnicode_Format by PyUnicode_FromFormat.

- Issue #13342: input() used to ignore sys.stdin's and sys.stdout's unicode
  error handler in interactive mode (when calling into PyOS_Readline()).

- Issue #9896: Add start, stop, and step attributes to range objects.

- Issue #13343: Fix a SystemError when a lambda expression uses a global
  variable in the default value of a keyword-only argument: ``lambda *,
  arg=GLOBAL_NAME: None``

- Issue #12797: Added custom opener parameter to builtin open() and
  FileIO.open().

- Issue #10519: Avoid unnecessary recursive function calls in
  setobject.c.

- Issue #10363: Deallocate global locks in Py_Finalize().

- Issue #13018: Fix reference leaks in error paths in dictobject.c.
  Patch by Suman Saha.

- Issue #13201: Define '==' and '!=' to compare range objects based on
  the sequence of values they define (instead of comparing based on
  object identity).

- Issue #1294232: In a few cases involving metaclass inheritance, the
  interpreter would sometimes invoke the wrong metaclass when building a new
  class object. These cases now behave correctly. Patch by Daniel Urban.

- Issue #12753: Add support for Unicode name aliases and named sequences.
  Both ``unicodedata.lookup()`` and '\N{...}' now resolve aliases,
  and ``unicodedata.lookup()`` resolves named sequences too.

- Issue #12170: The count(), find(), rfind(), index() and rindex() methods
  of bytes and bytearray objects now accept an integer between 0 and 255
  as their first argument.  Patch by Petri Lehtinen.

- Issue #12604: VTRACE macro expanded to no-op in _sre.c to avoid compiler
  warnings. Patch by Josh Triplett and Petri Lehtinen.

- Issue #12281: Rewrite the MBCS codec to handle correctly replace and ignore
  error handlers on all Windows versions. The MBCS codec is now supporting all
  error handlers, instead of only replace to encode and ignore to decode.

- Issue #13188: When called without an explicit traceback argument,
  generator.throw() now gets the traceback from the passed exception's
  ``__traceback__`` attribute.  Patch by Petri Lehtinen.

- Issue #13146: Writing a pyc file is now atomic under POSIX.

- Issue #7833: Extension modules built using distutils on Windows will no
  longer include a "manifest" to prevent them failing at import time in some
  embedded situations.

- PEP 3151 / issue #12555: reworking the OS and IO exception hierarchy.

- Issue #13560: Add PyUnicode_DecodeLocale(), PyUnicode_DecodeLocaleAndSize()
  and PyUnicode_EncodeLocale() functions to the C API to decode/encode from/to
  the current locale encoding.

- Add internal API for static strings (_Py_identifier et al.).

- Issue #13063: the Windows error ERROR_NO_DATA (numbered 232 and described
  as "The pipe is being closed") is now mapped to POSIX errno EPIPE
  (previously EINVAL).

- Issue #12911: Fix memory consumption when calculating the repr() of huge
  tuples or lists.

- PEP 393: flexible string representation. Thanks to Torsten Becker for the
  initial implementation, and Victor Stinner for various bug fixes.

- Issue #14081: The 'sep' and 'maxsplit' parameter to str.split, bytes.split,
  and bytearray.split may now be passed as keyword arguments.

- Issue #13012: The 'keepends' parameter to str.splitlines may now be passed
  as a keyword argument:  "my_string.splitlines(keepends=True)".  The same
  change also applies to bytes.splitlines and bytearray.splitlines.

- Issue #7732: Don't open a directory as a file anymore while importing a
  module. Ignore the direcotry if its name matchs the module name (e.g.
  "__init__.py") and raise a ImportError instead.

- Issue #13021: Missing decref on an error path.  Thanks to Suman Saha for
  finding the bug and providing a patch.

- Issue #12973: Fix overflow checks that relied on undefined behaviour in
  list_repeat (listobject.c) and islice_next (itertoolsmodule.c).  These bugs
  caused test failures with recent versions of Clang.

- Issue #12904: os.utime, os.futimes, os.lutimes, and os.futimesat now write
  atime and mtime with nanosecond precision on modern POSIX platforms.

  return the respective singleton instances.

- Forbid summing bytes with sum().

- Verify the types of AST strings and identifiers provided by the user before
  compiling them.

- Issue #12647: The None object now has a __bool__() method that returns False.
  Formerly, bool(None) returned False only because of special case logic
  in PyObject_IsTrue().

- Issue #12579: str.format_map() now raises a ValueError if used on a
  format string that contains positional fields. Initial patch by
  Julian Berman.

- Issue #10271: Allow warnings.showwarning() be any callable.

- Issue #11627: Fix segfault when __new__ on a exception returns a
  non-exception class.

- Issue #12149: Update the method cache after a type's dictionary gets
  cleared by the garbage collector.  This fixes a segfault when an instance
  and its type get caught in a reference cycle, and the instance's
  deallocator calls one of the methods on the type (e.g. when subclassing
  IOBase).  Diagnosis and patch by Davide Rizzo.

- Issue #9611, #9015: FileIO.read() clamps the length to INT_MAX on Windows.

- Issue #9642: Uniformize the tests on the availability of the mbcs codec, add
  a new HAVE_MBCS define.

- Issue #9642: Fix filesystem encoding initialization: use the ANSI code page
  on Windows if the mbcs codec is not available, and fail with a fatal error if
  we cannot get the locale encoding (if nl_langinfo(CODESET) is not available)
  instead of using UTF-8.

- When a generator yields, do not retain the caller's exception state on the
  generator.

- Issue #12475: Prevent generators from leaking their exception state into the
  caller's frame as they return for the last time.

- Issue #12291: You can now load multiple marshalled objects from a stream,
  with other data interleaved between marshalled objects.

- Issue #12356: When required positional or keyword-only arguments are not
  given, produce a informative error message which includes the name(s) of the
  missing arguments.

- Issue #12370: Fix super with no arguments when __class__ is overriden in the
  class body.

- Issue #12084: os.stat on Windows now works properly with relative symbolic
  links when called from any directory.

- Loosen type restrictions on the __dir__ method. __dir__ can now return any
  sequence, which will be converted to a list and sorted by dir().

- Issue #12265: Make error messages produced by passing an invalid set of
  arguments to a function more informative.

- Issue #12225: Still allow Python to build if Python is not in its hg repo or
  mercurial is not installed.

- Issue #1195: my_fgets() now always clears errors before calling fgets(). Fix
  the following case: sys.stdin.read() stopped with CTRL+d (end of file),
  raw_input() interrupted by CTRL+c.

- Issue #12216: Allow unexpected EOF errors to happen on any line of the file.

- Issue #12199: The TryExcept and TryFinally and AST nodes have been unified
  into a Try node.

- Issue #9670: Increase the default stack size for secondary threads on
  Mac OS X and FreeBSD to reduce the chances of a crash instead of a
  "maximum recursion depth" RuntimeError exception.
  (patch by Ronald Oussoren)

  the __dir__() methods of those types.

- Issue #5715: In socketserver, close the server socket in the child process.

- Correct lookup of __dir__ on objects. Among other things, this causes errors
  besides AttributeError found on lookup to be propagated.

- Issue #12060: Use sig_atomic_t type and volatile keyword in the signal
  module. Patch written by Charles-François Natali.

- Issue #1746656: Added the if_nameindex, if_indextoname, if_nametoindex
  methods to the socket module.

- Issue #12044: Fixed subprocess.Popen when used as a context manager to
  wait for the process to end when exiting the context to avoid unintentionally
  leaving zombie processes around.

- Issue #1195: Fix input() if it is interrupted by CTRL+d and then CTRL+c,
  clear the end-of-file indicator after CTRL+d.

- Issue #1856: Avoid crashes and lockups when daemon threads run while the
  interpreter is shutting down; instead, these threads are now killed when
  they try to take the GIL.

- Issue #9756: When calling a method descriptor or a slot wrapper descriptor,
  the check of the object type doesn't read the __class__ attribute anymore.
  Fix a crash if a class override its __class__ attribute (e.g. a proxy of the
  str type). Patch written by Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #10517: After fork(), reinitialize the TLS used by the PyGILState_*
  APIs, to avoid a crash with the pthread implementation in RHEL 5.  Patch
  by Charles-François Natali.

  between narrow and wide builds while optimizing BINARY_SUBSCR on non-BMP
  chars (e.g. "\U00012345"[0]).

- Issue #11845: Fix typo in rangeobject.c that caused a crash in
  compute_slice_indices.  Patch by Daniel Urban.

- Issue #5673: Added a `timeout` keyword argument to subprocess.Popen.wait,
  subprocess.Popen.communicated, subprocess.call, subprocess.check_call, and
  subprocess.check_output.  If the blocking operation takes more than `timeout`
  seconds, the `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` exception is raised.

- Issue #11650: PyOS_StdioReadline() retries fgets() if it was interrupted
  (EINTR), for example if the program is stopped with CTRL+z on Mac OS X. Patch

  negative zeros from being constant-folded properly.

- Issue #11395: io.FileIO().write() clamps the data length to 32,767 bytes on
  Windows if the file is a TTY to workaround a Windows bug. The Windows console
  returns an error (12: not enough space error) on writing into stdout if
  stdout mode is binary and the length is greater than 66,000 bytes (or less,
  depending on heap usage).

- Issue #11320: fix bogus memory management in Modules/getpath.c, leading to
  a possible crash when calling Py_SetPath().

- Issue #11432: A bug was introduced in subprocess.Popen on posix systems with
  3.2.0 where the stdout or stderr file descriptor being the same as the stdin
  file descriptor would raise an exception. webbrowser.open would fail. fixed.

- Issue #9856: Change object.__format__ with a non-empty format string
  to be a DeprecationWarning. In 3.2 it was a PendingDeprecationWarning.
  In 3.4 it will be a TypeError.

- Issue #11244: The peephole optimizer is now able to constant-fold
  arbitrarily complex expressions.  This also fixes a 3.2 regression where
  operations involving negative numbers were not constant-folded.

- Issue #11450: Don't truncate hg version info in Py_GetBuildInfo() when
  there are many tags (e.g. when using mq).  Patch by Nadeem Vawda.

- Issue #11335: Fixed a memory leak in list.sort when the key function
  throws an exception.

- Issue #8923: When a string is encoded to UTF-8 in strict mode, the result is

  Patch written by Ray Allen.

- Issue #11286: Raise a ValueError from calling PyMemoryView_FromBuffer with
  a buffer struct having a NULL data pointer.

- Issue #11272: On Windows, input() strips '\r' (and not only '\n'), and

  Patch by Torsten Becker.

- Issue #10830: Fix PyUnicode_FromFormatV("%c") for non-BMP characters on
  narrow build.

- Issue #11168: Remove filename debug variable from PyEval_EvalFrameEx().
  It encoded the Unicode filename to UTF-8, but the encoding fails on
  undecodable filename (on surrogate characters) which raises an unexpected
  UnicodeEncodeError on recursion limit.

- Issue #11187: Remove bootstrap code (use ASCII) of
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString(), it was replaced by a better fallback (use the
  locale encoding) in PyUnicode_EncodeFSDefault().

- Check for NULL result in PyType_FromSpec.

- Issue #10516: New copy() and clear() methods for lists and bytearrays.

- Issue #11386: bytearray.pop() now throws IndexError when the bytearray is
  empty, instead of OverflowError.

- Issue #13989: Document that GzipFile does not support text mode, and give a
  more helpful error message when opened with an invalid mode string.

- Issue #13590: On OS X 10.7 and 10.6 with Xcode 4.2, building
  Distutils-based packages with C extension modules may fail because
  Apple has removed gcc-4.2, the version used to build python.org
  64-bit/32-bit Pythons.  If the user does not explicitly override
  the default C compiler by setting the CC environment variable,
  Distutils will now attempt to compile extension modules with clang
  if gcc-4.2 is required but not found. Also as a convenience, if
  the user does explicitly set CC, substitute its value as the default
  compiler in the Distutils LDSHARED configuration variable for OS X.
  (Note, the python.org 32-bit-only Pythons use gcc-4.0 and the 10.4u
  SDK, neither of which are available in Xcode 4.  This change does not
  attempt to override settings to support their use with Xcode 4.)

- Issue #13960: HTMLParser is now able to handle broken comments when
  strict=False.

- Issue #13921: Undocument and clean up sqlite3.OptimizedUnicode,
  which is obsolete in Python 3.x. It's now aliased to str for

  working directory instead of '' in importlib.

- Issue #13609: Add two functions to query the terminal size:
  os.get_terminal_size (low level) and shutil.get_terminal_size (high level).
  Patch by Zbigniew Jędrzejewski-Szmek.

- Issue #13845: On Windows, time.time() now uses GetSystemTimeAsFileTime()
  instead of ftime() to have a resolution of 100 ns instead of 1 ms (the clock
  accuracy is between 0.5 ms and 15 ms).

- Issue #13846: Add time.monotonic(), monotonic clock.

- Issue #10968: Remove indirection in threading.  The public names (Event,
  Condition, etc.) used to be factory functions returning instances of hidden
  classes (_Event, _Condition, etc.), because (if Guido recalls correctly) this
  code pre-dates the ability to subclass extension types.  It is now possible
  to inherit from these classes, without having to import the private

  shutdown, if globals()['__file__'] is None.

- Issue #12451: pydoc: importfile() now opens the Python script in binary mode,
  instead of text mode using the locale encoding, to avoid encoding issues.

- Issue #9516: On Mac OS X, change Distutils to no longer globally attempt to
  check or set the MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET environment variable for the
  interpreter process.  This could cause failures in non-Distutils subprocesses
  and was unreliable since tests or user programs could modify the interpreter
  environment after Distutils set it.  Instead, have Distutils set the
  deployment target only in the environment of each build subprocess.  It is
  still possible to globally override the default by setting
  MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET before launching the interpreter; its value must be
  greater or equal to the default value, the value with which the interpreter
  was built.  Also, implement the same handling in packaging.

  such as test_io or test_subprocess.

- Issue #12624: It is now possible to fail after the first failure when
  running in verbose mode (``-v`` or ``-W``), by using the ``--failfast``

  Web site.

- Avoid failing in test_urllibnet.test_bad_address when some overzealous
  DNS service (e.g. OpenDNS) resolves a non-existent domain name.  The test

  test_tk or test_ttk_guionly under a username that is not currently logged
  in to the console windowserver (as may be the case under buildbot or ssh).

- Issue #12407: Explicitly skip test_capi.EmbeddingTest under Windows.

- Issue #12400: regrtest -W doesn't rerun the tests twice anymore, but captures
  the output and displays it on failure instead. regrtest -v doesn't print the
  error twice anymore if there is only one error.

- Issue #12141: Install copies of template C module file so that
  test_build_ext of test_distutils and test_command_build_ext of
  test_packaging are no longer silently skipped when
  run outside of a build directory.

- Issue #11223: Skip test_lock_acquire_interruption() and
  test_rlock_acquire_interruption() of test_threadsignals if a thread lock is
  implemented using a POSIX mutex and a POSIX condition variable. A POSIX
  condition variable cannot be interrupted by a signal (e.g. on Linux, the
  futex system call is restarted).
