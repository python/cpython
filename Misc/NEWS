What's New in Python 3.6.1?
===========================

*Release date: 2017-03-21*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- bpo-29723: The ``sys.path[0]`` initialization change for bpo-29139 caused a
  regression by revealing an inconsistency in how sys.path is initialized when
  executing ``__main__`` from a zipfile, directory, or other import location.
  The interpreter now consistently avoids ever adding the import location's
  parent directory to ``sys.path``, and ensures no other ``sys.path`` entries
  are inadvertently modified when inserting the import location named on the
  command line.

Build
-----

- bpo-27593: fix format of git information used in sys.version

- Fix incompatible comment in python.h

What's New in Python 3.6.0 beta 1?
==================================

*Release date: 2016-09-12*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #23722: The __class__ cell used by zero-argument super() is now
  initialized from type.__new__ rather than __build_class__, so class methods
  relying on that will now work correctly when called from metaclass methods
  during class creation. Patch by Martin Teichmann.

- Issue #25221: Fix corrupted result from PyLong_FromLong(0) when Python
  is compiled with NSMALLPOSINTS = 0.

- Issue #27080: Implement formatting support for PEP 515.  Initial patch
  by Chris Angelico.

- Issue #27199: In tarfile, expose copyfileobj bufsize to improve throughput.
  Patch by Jason Fried.

- Issue #27948: In f-strings, only allow backslashes inside the braces
  (where the expressions are).  This is a breaking change from the 3.6
  alpha releases, where backslashes are allowed anywhere in an
  f-string.  Also, require that expressions inside f-strings be
  enclosed within literal braces, and not escapes like
  f'\x7b"hi"\x7d'.

- Issue #28046: Remove platform-specific directories from sys.path.

- Issue #28071: Add early-out for differencing from an empty set.

- Issue #25758: Prevents zipimport from unnecessarily encoding a filename
  (patch by Eryk Sun)

- Issue #25856: The __module__ attribute of extension classes and functions
  now is interned. This leads to more compact pickle data with protocol 4.

  efficient bytecode. Patch by Demur Rumed, design by Serhiy Storchaka,
  reviewed by Serhiy Storchaka and Victor Stinner.

  Patch by Ivan Levkivskyi.

- Issue #26058: Add a new private version to the builtin dict type, incremented
  at each dictionary creation and at each dictionary change. Implementation of
  the PEP 509.

- Issue #27364: A backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence
  now generates a DeprecationWarning.  Patch by Emanuel Barry.

  ``exec_builtin_or_dynamic()``.

- Issue #27078: Added BUILD_STRING opcode.  Optimized f-strings evaluation.

- Issue #17884: Python now requires systems with inttypes.h and stdint.h

- Issue #27961: Require platforms to support ``long long``. Python hasn't
  compiled without ``long long`` for years, so this is basically a formality.

- Issue #27355: Removed support for Windows CE.  It was never finished,
  and Windows CE is no longer a relevant platform for Python.

- Implement PEP 523.

- Issue #27870: A left shift of zero by a large integer no longer attempts
  to allocate large amounts of memory.

- Issue #25402: In int-to-decimal-string conversion, improve the estimate
  of the intermediate memory required, and remove an unnecessarily strict
  overflow check. Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

- Issue #27214: In long_invert, be more careful about modifying object
  returned by long_add, and remove an unnecessary check for small longs.
  Thanks Oren Milman for analysis and patch.

- Issue #27506: Support passing the bytes/bytearray.translate() "delete"
  argument by keyword.

- Issue #27812: Properly clear out a generator's frame's backreference to the
  generator to prevent crashes in frame.clear().

  after use of 'def' in _PyState_AddModule().
  Initial patch by Christian Heimes.

- Issue #27792: The modulo operation applied to ``bool`` and other

  the return type depended on the input values. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- Issue #26984: int() now always returns an instance of exact int.

  ``Py_SSIZE_T_MAX``. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

- Issue #27782: Multi-phase extension module import now correctly allows the
  ``m_methods`` field to be used to add module level functions to instances
  of non-module types returned from ``Py_create_mod``. Patch by Xiang Zhang.

  for some types but not for others.  Fixed the inconsistency by
  accepting None for all numeric types.

  runpy.run_module() is found in sys.modules after parent packages are
  imported, but before the submodule is executed.

  Patch by Eryk Sun and Emanuel Barry.

- Issue #27558: Fix a SystemError in the implementation of "raise" statement.

- Issue #28043: SSLContext has improved default settings: OP_NO_SSLv2,
  OP_NO_SSLv3, OP_NO_COMPRESSION, OP_CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE,
  OP_SINGLE_DH_USE, OP_SINGLE_ECDH_USE and HIGH ciphers without MD5.

What's New in Python 3.6.0 alpha 1?
===================================

Release date: 2016-05-16

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #20041: Fixed TypeError when frame.f_trace is set to None.
  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- Issue #26168: Fixed possible refleaks in failing Py_BuildValue() with the "N"
  format unit.

- Issue #26991: Fix possible refleak when creating a function with annotations.

- Issue #27039: Fixed bytearray.remove() for values greater than 127.  Based on
  patch by Joe Jevnik.

- Issue #23640: int.from_bytes() no longer bypasses constructors for subclasses.

- Issue #27005: Optimized the float.fromhex() class method for exact float.
  It is now 2 times faster.

- Issue #18531: Single var-keyword argument of dict subtype was passed
  unscathed to the C-defined function.  Now it is converted to exact dict.

- Issue #26811: gc.get_objects() no longer contains a broken tuple with NULL
  pointer.

- Issue #20120: Use RawConfigParser for .pypirc parsing,
  removing support for interpolation unintentionally added
  with move to Python 3. Behavior no longer does any
  interpolation in .pypirc files, matching behavior in Python
  2.7 and Setuptools 19.0.

- Issue #26249: Memory functions of the :c:func:`PyMem_Malloc` domain
  (:c:data:`PYMEM_DOMAIN_MEM`) now use the :ref:`pymalloc allocator <pymalloc>`
  rather than system :c:func:`malloc`. Applications calling
  :c:func:`PyMem_Malloc` without holding the GIL can now crash: use
  ``PYTHONMALLOC=debug`` environment variable to validate the usage of memory
  allocators in your application.

- Issue #26802: Optimize function calls only using unpacking like
  ``func(*tuple)`` (no other positional argument, no keyword): avoid copying
  the tuple. Patch written by Joe Jevnik.

- Issue #26659: Make the builtin slice type support cycle collection.

- Issue #26718: super.__init__ no longer leaks memory if called multiple times.
  NOTE: A direct call of super.__init__ is not endorsed!

  bytearray, list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, OrderedDict, corresponding
  views and os.scandir() iterator.

- Issue #26574: Optimize ``bytes.replace(b'', b'.')`` and
  ``bytearray.replace(b'', b'.')``. Patch written by Josh Snider.

- Issue #26581: If coding cookie is specified multiple times on a line in
  Python source code file, only the first one is taken to account.

- Issue #19711: Add tests for reloading namespace packages.

- Issue #21099: Switch applicable importlib tests to use PEP 451 API.

- Issue #26563: Debug hooks on Python memory allocators now raise a fatal
  error if functions of the :c:func:`PyMem_Malloc` family are called without
  holding the GIL.

- Issue #26564: On error, the debug hooks on Python memory allocators now use
  the :mod:`tracemalloc` module to get the traceback where a memory block was
  allocated.

- Issue #26558: The debug hooks on Python memory allocator
  :c:func:`PyObject_Malloc` now detect when functions are called without
  holding the GIL.

- Issue #26516: Add :envvar:`PYTHONMALLOC` environment variable to set the
  Python memory allocators and/or install debug hooks.

- Issue #26516: The :c:func:`PyMem_SetupDebugHooks` function can now also be
  used on Python compiled in release mode.

- Issue #26516: The :envvar:`PYTHONMALLOCSTATS` environment variable can now
  also be used on Python compiled in release mode. It now has no effect if
  set to an empty string.

- Issue #26516: In debug mode, debug hooks are now also installed on Python
  memory allocators when Python is configured without pymalloc.

- Issue #26464: Fix str.translate() when string is ASCII and first replacements
  removes character, but next replacement uses a non-ASCII character or a
  string longer than 1 character. Regression introduced in Python 3.5.0.

- Issue #22836: Ensure exception reports from PyErr_Display() and
  PyErr_WriteUnraisable() are sensible even when formatting them produces
  secondary errors.  This affects the reports produced by
  sys.__excepthook__() and when __del__() raises an exception.

- Issue #26302: Correct behavior to reject comma as a legal character for
  cookie names.

- Issue #26136: Upgrade the warning when a generator raises StopIteration
  from PendingDeprecationWarning to DeprecationWarning.  Patch by Anish
  Shah.

- Issue #26204: The compiler now ignores all constant statements: bytes, str,
  int, float, complex, name constants (None, False, True), Ellipsis
  and ast.Constant; not only str and int. For example, ``1.0`` is now ignored
  in ``def f(): 1.0``.

- Issue #4806: Avoid masking the original TypeError exception when using star
  (*) unpacking in function calls.  Based on patch by Hagen Fürstenau and
  Daniel Urban.

- Issue #26146: Add a new kind of AST node: ``ast.Constant``. It can be used
  by external AST optimizers, but the compiler does not emit directly such
  node.

  small object allocator.  (Contributed by Julian Taylor.)

- Issue #18018: Import raises ImportError instead of SystemError if a relative
  import is attempted without a known parent package.

- Issue #25843: When compiling code, don't merge constants if they are equal
  but have a different types. For example, ``f1, f2 = lambda: 1, lambda: 1.0``
  is now correctly compiled to two different functions: ``f1()`` returns ``1``
  (``int``) and ``f2()`` returns ``1.0`` (``float``), even if ``1`` and ``1.0``
  are equal.

- Issue #26107: The format of the ``co_lnotab`` attribute of code objects
  changes to support negative line number delta.

- Issue #26154: Add a new private _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet() function to get
  the current Python thread state, but don't issue a fatal error if it is NULL.
  This new function must be used instead of accessing directly the
  _PyThreadState_Current variable.  The variable is no more exposed since
  Python 3.5.1 to hide the exact implementation of atomic C types, to avoid
  compiler issues.

- Issue #25791: If __package__ != __spec__.parent or if neither __package__ or
  __spec__ are defined then ImportWarning is raised.

- Issue #22995: [UPDATE] Comment out the one of the pickleability tests in
  _PyObject_GetState() due to regressions observed in Cython-based projects.

  subclasses of list or dict and haven't implemented any pickle-related
  methods (__reduce__, __reduce_ex__, __getnewargs__, __getnewargs_ex__,
  or __getstate__), can no longer be pickled.  Including memoryview.

- Issue #20440: Massive replacing unsafe attribute setting code with special
  macro Py_SETREF.

- Issue #25766: Special method __bytes__() now works in str subclasses.

  cache.

- Issue #5319: New Py_FinalizeEx() API allowing Python to set an exit status

  __getattr__.

- Issue #24731: Fixed crash on converting objects with special methods
  __bytes__, __trunc__, and __float__ returning instances of subclasses of
  bytes, int, and float to subclasses of bytes, int, and float correspondingly.

- Issue #25630: Fix a possible segfault during argument parsing in functions
  that accept filesystem paths.

- Issue #23564: Fixed a partially broken sanity check in the _posixsubprocess
  internals regarding how fds_to_pass were passed to the child.  The bug had
  no actual impact as subprocess.py already avoided it.

- Issue #25388: Fixed tokenizer crash when processing undecodable source code
  with a null byte.

- Issue #25462: The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.

  rejects builtin types with not defined __new__.

- Issue #24802: Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects.  These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they were.

- Issue #25555: Fix parser and AST: fill lineno and col_offset of "arg" node
  when compiling AST from Python objects.

- Issue #24726: Fixed a crash and leaking NULL in repr() of OrderedDict that
  was mutated by direct calls of dict methods.

  KeyError in C implementations as well as in Python implementation.

- Issue #25395: Fixed crash when highly nested OrderedDict structures were
  garbage collected.

- Issue #25401: Optimize bytes.fromhex() and bytearray.fromhex(): they are now
  between 2x and 3.5x faster.

- Issue #25399: Optimize bytearray % args using the new private _PyBytesWriter
  API. Formatting is now between 2.5 and 5 times faster.

- Issue #25274: sys.setrecursionlimit() now raises a RecursionError if the new
  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth. Modify
  also the "lower-water mark" formula to make it monotonic. This mark is used
  to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

- Issue #24402: Fix input() to prompt to the redirected stdout when
  sys.stdout.fileno() fails.

- Issue #25349: Optimize bytes % args using the new private _PyBytesWriter API.
  Formatting is now up to 2 times faster.

- Issue #24806: Prevent builtin types that are not allowed to be subclassed from
  being subclassed through multiple inheritance.

- Issue #25267: The UTF-8 encoder is now up to 75 times as fast for error
  handlers: ``ignore``, ``replace``, ``surrogateescape``, ``surrogatepass``.
  Patch co-written with Serhiy Storchaka.

- Issue #25280: Import trace messages emitted in verbose (-v) mode are no
  longer formatted twice.

- Issue #25227: Optimize ASCII and latin1 encoders with the ``surrogateescape``
  error handler: the encoders are now up to 3 times as fast. Initial patch
  written by Serhiy Storchaka.

- Issue #25003: On Solaris 11.3 or newer, os.urandom() now uses the
  getrandom() function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy()
  function is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom()
  doesn't need such high-quality entropy.

- Issue #9232: Modify Python's grammar to allow trailing commas in the
  argument list of a function declaration.  For example, "def f(\*, a =
  3,): pass" is now legal. Patch from Mark Dickinson.

- Issue #24965: Implement PEP 498 "Literal String Interpolation". This
  allows you to embed expressions inside f-strings, which are
  converted to normal strings at run time. Given x=3, then
  f'value={x}' == 'value=3'. Patch by Eric V. Smith.

- Issue #26478: Fix semantic bugs when using binary operators with dictionary
  views and tuples.

  packages (module splitted into multiple directories) for the package
  parameter.

- Issue #25195: Fix a regression in mock.MagicMock. _Call is a subclass of
  tuple (changeset 3603bae63c13 only works for classes) so we need to
  implement __ne__ ourselves.  Patch by Andrew Plummer.

  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455).
  The patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes.
  1. Suspend and resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait
  mechanism intended for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit).
  2. In gui.run, allow any existing interaction to terminate first.

- Change 'The program' to 'Your program' in an IDLE 'kill program?' message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

  Strings, comments, keywords, ... are still green, red, orange, ... .
  To use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the
  'Save as New Custom Theme' button and enter a new name,
  such as 'Custom Dark'.  The custom theme will work with any IDLE
  release, and can be modified.

- Issue #25199: Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.

- Issue #16893: Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display.
  The new idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html.

Release date: 2016-06-12

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #27066: Fixed SystemError if a custom opener (for open()) returns a
  negative number without setting an exception.

- Issue #20041: Fixed TypeError when frame.f_trace is set to None.
  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- Issue #26168: Fixed possible refleaks in failing Py_BuildValue() with the "N"
  format unit.

- Issue #26991: Fix possible refleak when creating a function with annotations.

- Issue #27039: Fixed bytearray.remove() for values greater than 127.  Patch by
  Joe Jevnik.

- Issue #23640: int.from_bytes() no longer bypasses constructors for subclasses.

- Issue #26811: gc.get_objects() no longer contains a broken tuple with NULL
  pointer.

- Issue #20120: Use RawConfigParser for .pypirc parsing,
  removing support for interpolation unintentionally added
  with move to Python 3. Behavior no longer does any
  interpolation in .pypirc files, matching behavior in Python
  2.7 and Setuptools 19.0.

- Issue #26659: Make the builtin slice type support cycle collection.

- Issue #26718: super.__init__ no longer leaks memory if called multiple times.
  NOTE: A direct call of super.__init__ is not endorsed!

- Issue #25339: PYTHONIOENCODING now has priority over locale in setting the
  error handler for stdin and stdout.

- Issue #26494: Fixed crash on iterating exhausting iterators.
  Affected classes are generic sequence iterators, iterators of str, bytes,
  bytearray, list, tuple, set, frozenset, dict, OrderedDict, corresponding
  views and os.scandir() iterator.

- Issue #26581: If coding cookie is specified multiple times on a line in
  Python source code file, only the first one is taken to account.

- Issue #26464: Fix str.translate() when string is ASCII and first replacements
  removes character, but next replacement uses a non-ASCII character or a
  string longer than 1 character. Regression introduced in Python 3.5.0.

- Issue #22836: Ensure exception reports from PyErr_Display() and
  PyErr_WriteUnraisable() are sensible even when formatting them produces
  secondary errors.  This affects the reports produced by
  sys.__excepthook__() and when __del__() raises an exception.

- Issue #26302: Correct behavior to reject comma as a legal character for
  cookie names.

- Issue #4806: Avoid masking the original TypeError exception when using star
  (*) unpacking in function calls.  Based on patch by Hagen Fürstenau and
  Daniel Urban.

- Issue #27138: Fix the doc comment for FileFinder.find_spec().

- Issue #26154: Add a new private _PyThreadState_UncheckedGet() function to get
  the current Python thread state, but don't issue a fatal error if it is NULL.
  This new function must be used instead of accessing directly the
  _PyThreadState_Current variable.  The variable is no more exposed since
  Python 3.5.1 to hide the exact implementation of atomic C types, to avoid
  compiler issues.

- Issue #26194:  Deque.insert() gave odd results for bounded deques that had
  reached their maximum size.  Now an IndexError will be raised when attempting
  to insert into a full deque.

- Issue #25843: When compiling code, don't merge constants if they are equal
  but have a different types. For example, ``f1, f2 = lambda: 1, lambda: 1.0``
  is now correctly compiled to two different functions: ``f1()`` returns ``1``
  (``int``) and ``f2()`` returns ``1.0`` (``int``), even if ``1`` and ``1.0``
  are equal.

- Issue #22995: [UPDATE] Comment out the one of the pickleability tests in
  _PyObject_GetState() due to regressions observed in Cython-based projects.

- Issue #25961: Disallowed null characters in the type name.

- Issue #25973: Fix segfault when an invalid nonlocal statement binds a name
  starting with two underscores.

- Issue #22995: Instances of extension types with a state that aren't
  subclasses of list or dict and haven't implemented any pickle-related
  methods (__reduce__, __reduce_ex__, __getnewargs__, __getnewargs_ex__,
  or __getstate__), can no longer be pickled.  Including memoryview.

- Issue #20440: Massive replacing unsafe attribute setting code with special
  macro Py_SETREF.

- Issue #25766: Special method __bytes__() now works in str subclasses.

- Issue #25421: __sizeof__ methods of builtin types now use dynamic basic size.
  This allows sys.getsize() to work correctly with their subclasses with
  __slots__ defined.

- Issue #25709: Fixed problem with in-place string concatenation and utf-8
  cache.

- Issue #27147: Mention PEP 420 in the importlib docs.

- Issue #24097: Fixed crash in object.__reduce__() if slot name is freed inside
  __getattr__.

- Issue #24731: Fixed crash on converting objects with special methods
  __bytes__, __trunc__, and __float__ returning instances of subclasses of
  bytes, int, and float to subclasses of bytes, int, and float correspondingly.

- Issue #26478: Fix semantic bugs when using binary operators with dictionary
  views and tuples.

- Issue #26171: Fix possible integer overflow and heap corruption in
  zipimporter.get_data().

- Issue #25660: Fix TAB key behaviour in REPL with readline.

- Issue #25887: Raise a RuntimeError when a coroutine object is awaited
  more than once.

- Issue #27243: Update the __aiter__ protocol: instead of returning
  an awaitable that resolves to an asynchronous iterator, the asynchronous
  iterator should be returned directly.  Doing the former will trigger a
  PendingDeprecationWarning.

What's New in Python 3.5.1 release candidate 1?
===============================================

Release date: 2015-11-22

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #25630: Fix a possible segfault during argument parsing in functions
  that accept filesystem paths.

- Issue #23564: Fixed a partially broken sanity check in the _posixsubprocess
  internals regarding how fds_to_pass were passed to the child.  The bug had
  no actual impact as subprocess.py already avoided it.

- Issue #25388: Fixed tokenizer crash when processing undecodable source code
  with a null byte.

- Issue #25462: The hash of the key now is calculated only once in most
  operations in C implementation of OrderedDict.

- Issue #22995: Default implementation of __reduce__ and __reduce_ex__ now
  rejects builtin types with not defined __new__.

- Issue #25555: Fix parser and AST: fill lineno and col_offset of "arg" node
  when compiling AST from Python objects.

- Issue #24802: Avoid buffer overreads when int(), float(), compile(), exec()
  and eval() are passed bytes-like objects.  These objects are not
  necessarily terminated by a null byte, but the functions assumed they were.

- Issue #24726: Fixed a crash and leaking NULL in repr() of OrderedDict that
  was mutated by direct calls of dict methods.

- Issue #25449: Iterating OrderedDict with keys with unstable hash now raises
  KeyError in C implementations as well as in Python implementation.

- Issue #25395: Fixed crash when highly nested OrderedDict structures were
  garbage collected.

- Issue #25274: sys.setrecursionlimit() now raises a RecursionError if the new
  recursion limit is too low depending at the current recursion depth. Modify
  also the "lower-water mark" formula to make it monotonic. This mark is used
  to decide when the overflowed flag of the thread state is reset.

- Issue #24402: Fix input() to prompt to the redirected stdout when
  sys.stdout.fileno() fails.

- Issue #24806: Prevent builtin types that are not allowed to be subclassed from
  being subclassed through multiple inheritance.

- Issue #24848: Fixed a number of bugs in UTF-7 decoding of misformed data.

- Issue #25280: Import trace messages emitted in verbose (-v) mode are no
  longer formatted twice.

- Issue #25003: On Solaris 11.3 or newer, os.urandom() now uses the
  getrandom() function instead of the getentropy() function. The getentropy()
  function is blocking to generate very good quality entropy, os.urandom()
  doesn't need such high-quality entropy.

- Issue #25182: The stdprinter (used as sys.stderr before the io module is
  imported at startup) now uses the backslashreplace error handler.

- Issue #25131: Make the line number and column offset of set/dict literals and
  comprehensions correspond to the opening brace.

- Issue #25150: Hide the private _Py_atomic_xxx symbols from the public
  Python.h header to fix a compilation error with OpenMP. PyThreadState_GET()
  becomes an alias to PyThreadState_Get() to avoid ABI incompatibilies.

Library
-------

- Issue #25626: Change three zlib functions to accept sizes that fit in
  Py_ssize_t, but internally cap those sizes to UINT_MAX.  This resolves a
  regression in 3.5 where GzipFile.read() failed to read chunks larger than 2
  or 4 GiB.  The change affects the zlib.Decompress.decompress() max_length
  parameter, the zlib.decompress() bufsize parameter, and the
  zlib.Decompress.flush() length parameter.

- Issue #25583: Avoid incorrect errors raised by os.makedirs(exist_ok=True)
  when the OS gives priority to errors such as EACCES over EEXIST.

- Issue #25593: Change semantics of EventLoop.stop() in asyncio.

- Issue #6973: When we know a subprocess.Popen process has died, do
  not allow the send_signal(), terminate(), or kill() methods to do
  anything as they could potentially signal a different process.

- Issue #25590: In the Readline completer, only call getattr() once per
  attribute.

  by wrapping a memoryview.  This was a regression made in 3.5a1.  Based
  on patch by Eryksun.

- Issue #25584: Added "escape" to the __all__ list in the glob module.

- Issue #25584: Fixed recursive glob() with patterns starting with '\*\*'.

  Original patch by John Mark Vandenberg.

- Issue #25515: Always use os.urandom as a source of randomness in uuid.uuid4.

  that caused segmentation fault or hang in iterating after moving several
  items to the start of ordered dict.

- Issue #25364: zipfile now works in threads disabled builds.

- Issue #25328: smtpd's SMTPChannel now correctly raises a ValueError if both
  decode_data and enable_SMTPUTF8 are set to true.

- Issue #25316: distutils raises OSError instead of DistutilsPlatformError
  when MSVC is not installed.

- Issue #25380: Fixed protocol for the STACK_GLOBAL opcode in
  pickletools.opcodes.

- Issue #23972: Updates asyncio datagram create method allowing reuseport
  and reuseaddr socket options to be set prior to binding the socket.
  Mirroring the existing asyncio create_server method the reuseaddr option
  for datagram sockets defaults to True if the O/S is 'posix' (except if the
  platform is Cygwin). Patch by Chris Laws.

- Issue #25304: Add asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe().  This lets you
  submit a coroutine to a loop from another thread, returning a
  concurrent.futures.Future.  By Vincent Michel.

- Issue #25232: Fix CGIRequestHandler to split the query from the URL at the
  first question mark (?) rather than the last. Patch from Xiang Zhang.

- Issue #24657: Prevent CGIRequestHandler from collapsing slashes in the
  query part of the URL as if it were a path. Patch from Xiang Zhang.

- Issue #24483: C implementation of functools.lru_cache() now calculates key's
  hash only once.

  now accept the self and the dict keyword arguments.

- Issue #22609: Constructor of collections.UserDict now accepts the self keyword
  argument.

- Issue #25111: Fixed comparison of traceback.FrameSummary.

- Issue #25262: Added support for BINBYTES8 opcode in Python implementation of
  unpickler.  Highest 32 bits of 64-bit size for BINUNICODE8 and BINBYTES8
  opcodes no longer silently ignored on 32-bit platforms in C implementation.

- Issue #25034: Fix string.Formatter problem with auto-numbering and
  nested format_specs. Patch by Anthon van der Neut.

- Issue #25233: Rewrite the guts of asyncio.Queue and
  asyncio.Semaphore to be more understandable and correct.

- Issue #25203: Failed readline.set_completer_delims() no longer left the
  module in inconsistent state.

- Issue #23600: Default implementation of tzinfo.fromutc() was returning
  wrong results in some cases.

- Issue #23329: Allow the ssl module to be built with older versions of
  LibreSSL.

- Prevent overflow in _Unpickler_Read.

- Issue #25047: The XML encoding declaration written by Element Tree now
  respects the letter case given by the user. This restores the ability to
  write encoding names in uppercase like "UTF-8", which worked in Python 2.

- Issue #25135: Make deque_clear() safer by emptying the deque before clearing.
  This helps avoid possible reentrancy issues.

- Issue #19143: platform module now reads Windows version from kernel32.dll to
  avoid compatibility shims.

- Issue #25092: Fix datetime.strftime() failure when errno was already set to
  EINVAL.

- Issue #23517: Fix rounding in fromtimestamp() and utcfromtimestamp() methods
  of datetime.datetime: microseconds are now rounded to nearest with ties
  going to nearest even integer (ROUND_HALF_EVEN), instead of being rounding
  towards minus infinity (ROUND_FLOOR). It's important that these methods use
  the same rounding mode than datetime.timedelta to keep the property:
  (datetime(1970,1,1) + timedelta(seconds=t)) == datetime.utcfromtimestamp(t).
  It also the rounding mode used by round(float) for example.

- Issue #25155: Fix datetime.datetime.now() and datetime.datetime.utcnow() on
  Windows to support date after year 2038. It was a regression introduced in
  Python 3.5.0.

- Issue #25108: Omitted internal frames in traceback functions print_stack(),
  format_stack(), and extract_stack() called without arguments.

- Issue #25118: Fix a regression of Python 3.5.0 in os.waitpid() on Windows.

- Issue #24684: socket.socket.getaddrinfo() now calls
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() instead of calling the encode() method of the
  host, to handle correctly custom string with an encode() method which doesn't
  return a byte string. The encoder of the IDNA codec is now called directly
  instead of calling the encode() method of the string.

- Issue #25060: Correctly compute stack usage of the BUILD_MAP opcode.

- Issue #24857: Comparing call_args to a long sequence now correctly returns a
  boolean result instead of raising an exception.  Patch by A Kaptur.

- Issue #23144: Make sure that HTMLParser.feed() returns all the data, even
  when convert_charrefs is True.

- Issue #24982: shutil.make_archive() with the "zip" format now adds entries
  for directories (including empty directories) in ZIP file.

- Issue #25019: Fixed a crash caused by setting non-string key of expat parser.
  Based on patch by John Leitch.

  in an infinite loop.  Patch by Xavier de Gaye.

- Issue #24891: Fix a race condition at Python startup if the file descriptor
  of stdin (0), stdout (1) or stderr (2) is closed while Python is creating
  sys.stdin, sys.stdout and sys.stderr objects. These attributes are now set
  to None if the creation of the object failed, instead of raising an OSError
  exception. Initial patch written by Marco Paolini.

- Issue #24992: Fix error handling and a race condition (related to garbage
  collection) in collections.OrderedDict constructor.

- Issue #24881: Fixed setting binary mode in Python implementation of FileIO
  on Windows and Cygwin.  Patch from Akira Li.

  nonblocking.

- Issue #25319: When threading.Event is reinitialized, the underlying condition
  should use a regular lock rather than a recursive lock.

- Issue #21112: Fix regression in unittest.expectedFailure on subclasses.
  Patch from Berker Peksag.

- Issue #24764: cgi.FieldStorage.read_multi() now ignores the Content-Length
  header in part headers. Patch written by Peter Landry and reviewed by Pierre
  Quentel.

- Issue #24913: Fix overrun error in deque.index().
  Found by John Leitch and Bryce Darling.

IDLE
----

- Issue #15348: Stop the debugger engine (normally in a user process)
  before closing the debugger window (running in the IDLE process).
  This prevents the RuntimeErrors that were being caught and ignored.

- Issue #24455: Prevent IDLE from hanging when a) closing the shell while the
  debugger is active (15347); b) closing the debugger with the [X] button
  (15348); and c) activating the debugger when already active (24455).
  The patch by Mark Roseman does this by making two changes.
  1. Suspend and resume the gui.interaction method with the tcl vwait
  mechanism intended for this purpose (instead of root.mainloop & .quit).
  2. In gui.run, allow any existing interaction to terminate first.

- Change 'The program' to 'Your program' in an IDLE 'kill program?' message
  to make it clearer that the program referred to is the currently running
  user program, not IDLE itself.

  dialog rather than a separate dialog.  The former tabs are now a sorted
  list.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- Issue #22726: Re-activate the config dialog help button with some content
  about the other buttons and the new IDLE Dark theme.

- Issue #24820: IDLE now has an 'IDLE Dark' built-in text color theme.
  It is more or less IDLE Classic inverted, with a cobalt blue background.
  Strings, comments, keywords, ... are still green, red, orange, ... .
  To use it with IDLEs released before November 2015, hit the
  'Save as New Custom Theme' button and enter a new name,
  such as 'Custom Dark'.  The custom theme will work with any IDLE
  release, and can be modified.

- Issue #25224: README.txt is now an idlelib index for IDLE developers and
  curious users.  The previous user content is now in the IDLE doc chapter.
  'IDLE' now means 'Integrated Development and Learning Environment'.

- Issue #24820: Users can now set breakpoint colors in
  Settings -> Custom Highlighting.  Original patch by Mark Roseman.

- Issue #24972: Inactive selection background now matches active selection
  background, as configured by users, on all systems.  Found items are now
  always highlighted on Windows.  Initial patch by Mark Roseman.

- Issue #24570: Idle: make calltip and completion boxes appear on Macs
  affected by a tk regression.  Initial patch by Mark Roseman.

- Issue #24988: Idle ScrolledList context menus (used in debugger)
  now work on Mac Aqua.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- Issue #24801: Make right-click for context menu work on Mac Aqua.
  Patch by Mark Roseman.

- Issue #25173: Associate tkinter messageboxes with a specific widget.
  For Mac OSX, make them a 'sheet'.  Patch by Mark Roseman.

  * Properly indent fixed-pitch text (patch by Mark Roseman).
  * Give code snippet a very Sphinx-like light blueish-gray background.
  * Re-use initial width and height set by users for shell and editor.
  * When the Table of Contents (TOC) menu is used, put the section header
  at the top of the screen.

- Issue #25199: Idle: add synchronization comments for future maintainers.

- Issue #16893: Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display.
  The new idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html.
  It looks better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released.
  The tkinter html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman.
  The now unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are deprecated.

- Issue #24199: Deprecate unused idlelib.idlever with possible removal in 3.6.

- Issue #24790: Remove extraneous code (which also create 2 & 3 conflicts).

  and default behaviour and consistency suggestions for user-defined classes.
  Patch from Andy Maier.

  file archives of Python code. Registered ".pyz" and ".pyzw" extensions
  on Windows for these archives (PEP 441).

- Issue #23715: :func:`signal.sigwaitinfo` and :func:`signal.sigtimedwait` are
  now retried when interrupted by a signal not in the *sigset* parameter, if
  the signal handler does not raise an exception. signal.sigtimedwait()
  recomputes the timeout with a monotonic clock when it is retried.

  directory.

- Issue #15759: "make suspicious", "make linkcheck" and "make doctest" in Doc/
  now display special message when and only when there are failures.

- Issue #21141: The Windows build process no longer attempts to find Perl,
  instead relying on OpenSSL source being configured and ready to build.  The
  ``PCbuild\build_ssl.py`` script has been re-written and re-named to
  ``PCbuild\prepare_ssl.py``, and takes care of configuring OpenSSL source
  for both 32 and 64 bit platforms.  OpenSSL sources obtained from

- Issue #21233: Add new C functions: PyMem_RawCalloc(), PyMem_Calloc(),
  PyObject_Calloc(), _PyObject_GC_Calloc(). bytes(int) is now using
  ``calloc()`` instead of ``malloc()`` for large objects which is faster and
  use less memory.

- Issue #20942: PyImport_ImportFrozenModuleObject() no longer sets __file__ to
  match what importlib does; this affects _frozen_importlib as well as any
  module loaded using imp.init_frozen().

  as legacy links from the distutils docs, as they still contain some
  required reference material for tool developers that isn't recorded
  anywhere else.
