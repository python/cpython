What's New in Python 3.3 Alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: XX-XXX-20XX*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #5057: fix a bug in the peepholer that led to non-portable pyc files
  between narrow and wide builds while optimizing BINARY_SUBSCR on non-BMP
  chars (e.g. "\U00012345"[0]).

- Issue #11845: Fix typo in rangeobject.c that caused a crash in
  compute_slice_indices.  Patch by Daniel Urban.

- Issue #5673: Added a `timeout` keyword argument to subprocess.Popen.wait,
  subprocess.Popen.communicated, subprocess.call, subprocess.check_call, and
  subprocess.check_output.  If the blocking operation takes more than `timeout`
  seconds, the `subprocess.TimeoutExpired` exception is raised.

- Issue #11650: PyOS_StdioReadline() retries fgets() if it was interrupted
  (EINTR), for example if the program is stopped with CTRL+z on Mac OS X. Patch
  written by Charles-Francois Natali.

- Issue #9319: Include the filename in "Non-UTF8 code ..." syntax error.

- Issue #10785: Store the filename as Unicode in the Python parser.

- Issue #11619: _PyImport_LoadDynamicModule() doesn't encode the path to bytes
  on Windows.

- Issue #10998: Remove mentions of -Q, sys.flags.division_warning and
  Py_DivisionWarningFlag left over from Python 2.

- Issue #11244: Remove an unnecessary peepholer check that was preventing
  negative zeros from being constant-folded properly.

- Issue #11395: io.FileIO().write() clamps the data length to 32,767 bytes on
  Windows if the file is a TTY to workaround a Windows bug. The Windows console
  returns an error (12: not enough space error) on writing into stdout if
  stdout mode is binary and the length is greater than 66,000 bytes (or less,
  depending on heap usage).

- Issue #11320: fix bogus memory management in Modules/getpath.c, leading to
  a possible crash when calling Py_SetPath().

- _ast.__version__ is now a Mercurial integer and hex revision.

- Issue #11432: A bug was introduced in subprocess.Popen on posix systems with
  3.2.0 where the stdout or stderr file descriptor being the same as the stdin
  file descriptor would raise an exception. webbrowser.open would fail. fixed.

- Issue #9856: Change object.__format__ with a non-empty format string
  to be a DeprecationWarning. In 3.2 it was a PendingDeprecationWarning.
  In 3.4 it will be a TypeError.

- Issue #11244: The peephole optimizer is now able to constant-fold
  arbitrarily complex expressions.  This also fixes a 3.2 regression where
  operations involving negative numbers were not constant-folded.

- Issue #11450: Don't truncate hg version info in Py_GetBuildInfo() when
  there are many tags (e.g. when using mq).  Patch by Nadeem Vawda.

- Issue #11335: Fixed a memory leak in list.sort when the key function
  throws an exception.

- Issue #8923: When a string is encoded to UTF-8 in strict mode, the result is
  cached into the object. Examples: str.encode(), str.encode('utf-8'),
  PyUnicode_AsUTF8String() and PyUnicode_AsEncodedString(unicode, "utf-8",
  NULL).

- Issue #10831: PyUnicode_FromFormat() supports %li, %lli and %zi formats.

- Issue #10829: Refactor PyUnicode_FromFormat(), use the same function to parse
  the format string in the 3 steps, fix crashs on invalid format strings.

- Issue #11246: Fix PyUnicode_FromFormat("%V") to decode the byte string from
  UTF-8 (with replace error handler) instead of ISO-8859-1 (in strict mode).
  Patch written by Ray Allen.

- Issue #11286: Raise a ValueError from calling PyMemoryView_FromBuffer with
  a buffer struct having a NULL data pointer.

- Issue #11272: On Windows, input() strips '\r' (and not only '\n'), and
  sys.stdin uses universal newline (replace '\r\n' by '\n').

- Issue #10830: Fix PyUnicode_FromFormatV("%c") for non-BMP characters on
  narrow build.

- Issue #11168: Remove filename debug variable from PyEval_EvalFrameEx().
  It encoded the Unicode filename to UTF-8, but the encoding fails on
  undecodable filename (on surrogate characters) which raises an unexpected
  UnicodeEncodeError on recursion limit.

- Issue #11187: Remove bootstrap code (use ASCII) of
  PyUnicode_AsEncodedString(), it was replaced by a better fallback (use the
  locale encoding) in PyUnicode_EncodeFSDefault().

- Check for NULL result in PyType_FromSpec.

- Issue #10516: New copy() and clear() methods for lists and bytearrays.

- Issue #11386: bytearray.pop() now throws IndexError when the bytearray is
  empty, instead of OverflowError.

  2047 encoding when the realname contains non-ASCII characters.

- Issue #10963: Ensure that subprocess.communicate() never raises EPIPE.

- Issue #10791: Implement missing method GzipFile.read1(), allowing GzipFile

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10451: memoryview objects could allow to mutate a readable buffer.
  Initial patch by Ross Lagerwall.

Library
-------

- Issue #9124: mailbox now accepts binary input and reads and writes mailbox
  files in binary mode, using the email package's binary support to parse
  arbitrary email messages.  StringIO and text file input is deprecated,
  and string input fails early if non-ASCII characters are used, where
  previously it would fail when the email was processed in a later step.

- Issue #10845: Mitigate the incompatibility between the multiprocessing
  module on Windows and the use of package, zipfile or directory execution
  by special casing main modules that actually *are* called __main__.py.

- Issue #11045: Protect logging call against None argument.

- Issue #11052: Correct IDLE menu accelerators on Mac OS X for Save
  commands.

- Issue #11053: Fix IDLE "Syntax Error" windows to behave as in 2.x,
  preventing a confusing hung appearance on OS X with the windows
  obscured.

- Issue #10940: Workaround an IDLE hang on Mac OS X 10.6 when using the
  menu accelerators for Open Module, Go to Line, and New Indent Width.
  The accelerators still work but no longer appear in the menu items.

- Issue #10989: Fix a crash on SSLContext.load_verify_locations(None, True).

- Issue #11020: Command-line pyclbr was broken because of missing 2-to-3
  conversion.

- Issue #11019: Fixed BytesGenerator so that it correctly handles a Message
  with a None body.

- Issue #11014: Make 'filter' argument in tarfile.Tarfile.add() into a
  keyword-only argument.  The preceding positional argument was deprecated,
  so it made no sense to add filter as a positional argument.

- Issue #11004: Repaired edge case in deque.count().

- Issue #10974: IDLE no longer crashes if its recent files list includes files
  with non-ASCII characters in their path names.

- Have hashlib.algorithms_available and hashlib.algorithms_guaranteed both
  return sets instead of one returning a tuple and the other a frozenset.

- Issue #10987: Fix the recursion limit handling in the _pickle module.

- Issue #10983: Fix several bugs making tunnel requests in http.client.

- Issue #10955: zipimport uses ASCII encoding instead of cp437 to decode
  filenames, at bootstrap, if the codec registry is not ready yet. It is still
  possible to have non-ASCII filenames using the Unicode flag (UTF-8 encoding)
  for all file entries in the ZIP file.

- Issue #10949: Improved robustness of rotating file handlers.

- Issue #10955: Fix a potential crash when trying to mmap() a file past its
  length.  Initial patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10898: Allow compiling the posix module when the C library defines
  a symbol named FSTAT.

- Issue #10980: the HTTP server now encodes headers with iso-8859-1 (latin1)
  encoding.  This is the preferred encoding of PEP 3333 and the base encoding
  of HTTP 1.1.

- To match the behaviour of HTTP server, the HTTP client library now also
  encodes headers with iso-8859-1 (latin1) encoding.  It was already doing
  that for incoming headers which makes this behaviour now consistent in
  both incoming and outgoing direction.

- Issue #9509: argparse now properly handles IOErrors raised by
  argparse.FileType.

- Issue #10961: The new pydoc server now better handles exceptions raised
  during request handling.

- Issue #10680: Fix mutually exclusive arguments for argument groups in
  argparse.

Build
-----

- Issue #11054: Allow Mac OS X installer builds to again work on 10.5 with
  the system-provided Python.

  by Matt Bandy.

- Issue #10841: On Windows, set the binary mode on stdin, stdout, stderr and all
  io.FileIO objects (to not translate newlines, \r\n <=> \n).  The Python parser
  translates newlines (\r\n => \n).

- Remove buffer API from stable ABI for now, see #10181.

- Issue #8651: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise an OverflowError if the file
  doesn't have PY_SSIZE_T_CLEAN define and the size doesn't fit in an int
  (length bigger than 2^31-1 bytes).

- Issue #9015, #9611: FileIO.readinto(), FileIO.write(), os.write() and
  stdprinter.write() clamp the length to 2^31-1 on Windows.

- Issue #8278: On Windows and with a NTFS filesystem, os.stat() and os.utime()
  can now handle dates after 2038.

- Issue #10780: PyErr_SetFromWindowsErrWithFilename() and
  PyErr_SetExcFromWindowsErrWithFilename() decode the filename from the
  filesystem encoding instead of UTF-8.

- Issue #10779: PyErr_WarnExplicit() decodes the filename from the filesystem
  encoding instead of UTF-8.

  SyntaxError.

Library
-------

- Issue #10916: mmap should not segfault when a file is mapped using 0 as length
  and a non-zero offset, and an attempt to read past the end of file is made
  (IndexError is raised instead).  Patch by Ross Lagerwall.

- Issue #10907: Warn OS X 10.6 IDLE users to use ActiveState Tcl/Tk 8.5, rather
  than the currently problematic Apple-supplied one, when running with the
  64-/32-bit installer variant.

- Issue #4953: cgi.FieldStorage and cgi.parse() parse the request as bytes, not
  as unicode, and accept binary files. Add encoding and errors attributes to
  cgi.FieldStorage. Patch written by Pierre Quentel (with many inputs by Glenn
  Linderman).

- Add encoding and errors arguments to urllib.parse_qs() and urllib.parse_qsl().

- Issue #10899: No function type annotations in the standard library.  Removed
  function type annotations from _pyio.py.

- Issue #10875: Update Regular Expression HOWTO; patch by 'SilentGhost'.

- Issue #10872: The repr() of TextIOWrapper objects now includes the mode
  if available.

- Issue #10869: Fixed bug where ast.increment_lineno modified the root node
  twice.

- Issue #5871: email.header.Header.encode now raises an error if any
  continuation line in the formatted value has no leading white space and looks
  like a header.  Since Generator uses Header to format all headers, this check
  is made for all headers in any serialized message at serialization time.  This
  provides protection against header injection attacks.

- Issue #10859: Make ``contextlib.GeneratorContextManager`` officially
  private by renaming it to ``_GeneratorContextManager``.

- Issue #10042: Fixed the total_ordering decorator to handle cross-type
  comparisons that could lead to infinite recursion.

- Issue #10686: the email package now :rfc:`2047`\ -encodes headers with
  non-ASCII bytes (parsed by a Bytes Parser) when doing conversion to 7bit-clean
  presentation, instead of replacing them with ?s.

- email.header.Header was incorrectly encoding folding white space when
  rfc2047-encoding header values with embedded newlines, leaving them without
  folding whitespace.  It now uses the continuation_ws, as it does for
  continuation lines that it creates itself.

- Issue #1777412, #10827: Changed the rules for 2-digit years. The
  time.asctime(), time.ctime() and time.strftime() functions will now format
  any year when ``time.accept2dyear`` is False and will accept years >= 1000
  otherwise. ``time.mktime`` and ``time.strftime`` now accept full range
  supported by the OS. With Visual Studio or on Solaris, the year is limited to
  the range [1; 9999]. Conversion of 2-digit years to 4-digit is deprecated.

- Issue #7858: Raise an error properly when os.utime() fails under Windows
  on an existing file.

- Issue #3839: wsgiref should not override a Content-Length header set by
  the application.  Initial patch by Clovis Fabricio.

- Issue #10492: bdb.Bdb.run() only traces the execution of the code, not the
  compilation (if the input is a string).

- Issue #7995: When calling accept() on a socket with a timeout, the returned
  socket is now always blocking, regardless of the operating system.

- Issue #10756: atexit normalizes the exception before displaying it. Patch by
  Andreas Stührk.

- Issue #10790: email.header.Header.append's charset logic now works correctly
  for charsets whose output codec is different from its input codec.

- Issue #10819: SocketIO.name property returns -1 when its closed, instead of
  raising a ValueError, to fix repr().

- Issue #8650: zlib.compress() and zlib.decompress() raise an OverflowError if
  the input buffer length doesn't fit into an unsigned int (length bigger than
  2^32-1 bytes).

- Issue #6643: Reinitialize locks held within the threading module after fork to
  avoid a potential rare deadlock or crash on some platforms.

- Issue #10806, issue #9905: Fix subprocess pipes when some of the standard file
  descriptors (0, 1, 2) are closed in the parent process.  Initial patch by Ross
  Lagerwall.

- `unittest.TestCase` can be instantiated without a method name; for simpler
  exploration from the interactive interpreter.

- Issue #10798: Reject supporting concurrent.futures if the system has too
  few POSIX semaphores.

- Issue #10807: Remove base64, bz2, hex, quopri, rot13, uu and zlib codecs from
  the codec aliases. They are still accessible via codecs.lookup().

- Issue #10801: In zipfile, support different encodings for the header and the
  filenames.

- Issue #6285: IDLE no longer crashes on missing help file; patch by Scott
  David Daniels.

- Fix collections.OrderedDict.setdefault() so that it works in subclasses that
  define __missing__().

- Issue #10786: unittest.TextTestRunner default stream no longer bound at import
  time. `sys.stderr` now looked up at instantiation time.  Fix contributed by
  Mark Roddy.

- Issue #10753: Characters ';', '=' and ',' in the PATH_INFO environment variable
  won't be quoted when the URI is constructed by the wsgiref.util's request_uri
  method. According to RFC 3986, these characters can be a part of params in
  PATH component of URI and need not be quoted.

- Issue #10738: Fix webbrowser.Opera.raise_opts.

- Issue #9824: SimpleCookie now encodes , and ; in values to cater to how
  browsers actually parse cookies.

- Issue #9333: os.symlink now available regardless of user privileges.  The
  function now raises OSError on Windows >=6.0 when the user is unable to create
  symbolic links. XP and 2003 still raise NotImplementedError.

- Issue #10783: struct.pack() no longer implicitly encodes unicode to UTF-8.

- Issue #10730: Add SVG mime types to mimetypes module.

- Issue #10768: Make the Tkinter ScrolledText widget work again.

- Issue #10777: Fix "dictionary changed size during iteration" bug in
  ElementTree register_namespace().

- Issue #10626: test_logging now preserves logger disabled states.

- Issue #10774: test_logging now removes temp files created during tests.

- Issue #5258/#10642: if site.py encounters a .pth file that generates an error,
  it now prints the filename, line number, and traceback to stderr and skips
  the rest of that individual file, instead of stopping processing entirely.

- Issue #10763: subprocess.communicate() closes stdout and stderr if both are
  pipes (bug specific to Windows).

- Issue #1693546: fix email.message RFC 2231 parameter encoding to be in better
  compliance (no "s around encoded values).

- Improved the diff message in the unittest module's assertCountEqual().

- Issue #1155362: email.utils.parsedate_tz now handles a missing space before
  the '-' of a timezone field as well as before a '+'.

- Issue #4871: The zipfile module now gives a more useful error message if
  an attempt is made to use a string to specify the archive password.

- Issue #10750: The ``raw`` attribute of buffered IO objects is now read-only.

- Deprecated assertDictContainsSubset() in the unittest module.

C-API
-----

- Issue #10913: Deprecate misleading functions PyEval_AcquireLock() and
  PyEval_ReleaseLock().  The thread-state aware APIs should be used instead.

  2.2.

Build

  and DragonFly BSD.  Patch by Nicolas Joly.

- Issue #10679: The "idle", "pydoc" and "2to3" scripts are now installed with
  a version-specific suffix on "make altinstall".

- Issue #10655: Fix the build on PowerPC on Linux with GCC when building with
  timestamp profiling (--with-tsc): the preprocessor test for the PowerPC
  support now looks for "__powerpc__" as well as "__ppc__": the latter seems to
  only be present on OS X; the former is the correct one for Linux with GCC.

- Issue #1099: Fix the build on MacOSX when building a framework with pydebug
  using GCC 4.0.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 4?
=================================

*Release date: 13-Nov-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10372: Import the warnings module only after the IO library is
  initialized, so as to avoid bootstrap issues with the '-W' option.

- Issue #10293: Remove obsolete field in the PyMemoryView structure, unused
  undocumented value PyBUF_SHADOW, and strangely-looking code in
  PyMemoryView_GetContiguous.

- Issue #6081: Add str.format_map(), similar to ``str.format(**mapping)``.

- If FileIO.__init__ fails, close the file descriptor.

- Issue #10221: dict.pop(k) now has a key error message that includes the
  missing key (same message d[k] returns for missing keys).

- Issue #5437: A preallocated MemoryError instance should not keep traceback
  data (including local variables caught in the stack trace) alive infinitely.

- Issue #10186: Fix the SyntaxError caret when the offset is equal to the length
  of the offending line.

- Issue #10089: Add support for arbitrary -X options on the command line.  They
  can be retrieved through a new attribute ``sys._xoptions``.

- Issue #4388: On Mac OS X, decode command line arguments from UTF-8, instead of
  the locale encoding.  If the LANG (and LC_ALL and LC_CTYPE) environment
  variable is not set, the locale encoding is ISO-8859-1, whereas most programs
  (including Python) expect UTF-8.  Python already uses UTF-8 for the filesystem
  encoding and to encode command line arguments on this OS.

- Issue #9713, #10114: Parser functions (e.g. PyParser_ASTFromFile) expect
  filenames encoded to the filesystem encoding with the surrogateescape error
  handler (to support undecodable bytes), instead of UTF-8 in strict mode.

- Issue #9418: Moved private string methods ``_formatter_parser`` and
  ``_formatter_field_name_split`` into a new ``_string`` module.

- Issue #9992: Remove PYTHONFSENCODING environment variable.

  response, instead of raising an exception.

- wsgiref now implements and validates PEP 3333, rather than an experimental
  extension of PEP 333.  (Note: earlier versions of Python 3.x may have
  incorrectly validated some non-compliant applications as WSGI compliant; if
  your app validates with Python <3.2b1+, but not on this version, it is likely
  the case that your app was not compliant.)

- Issue #7523: Add SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK to the socket module, where
  supported by the system.  Patch by Nikita Vetoshkin.

- Issue #10063: file:// scheme will stop accessing remote hosts via ftp

  access via file:// scheme.

- Issue #1710703: Write structures for an empty ZIP archive when a ZipFile is
  created in modes 'a' or 'w' and then closed without adding any files. Raise

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 3?
=================================

*Release date: 09-Oct-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #10068: Global objects which have reference cycles with their module's
  dict are now cleared again. This causes issue #7140 to appear again.

- Issue #9738: Document PyErr_SetString() and PyErr_SetFromErrnoWithFilename()
  encodings.

- ast.literal_eval() can now handle negative numbers.  It is also a little more
  liberal in what it accepts without compromising the safety of the evaluation.
  For example, 3j+4 and 3+4+5 are both accepted.

- Issue #10006: type.__abstractmethods__ now raises an AttributeError.  As a
  result metaclasses can now be ABCs (see #9533).

- Issue #8670: ctypes.c_wchar supports non-BMP characters with 32 bits wchar_t.

- Issue #8670: PyUnicode_AsWideChar() and PyUnicode_AsWideCharString() replace
  UTF-16 surrogate pairs by single non-BMP characters for 16 bits Py_UNICODE and
  32 bits wchar_t (eg. Linux in narrow build).

- Issue #10003: Allow handling of SIGBREAK on Windows. Fixes a regression
  introduced by issue #9324.

- Issue #9979: Create function PyUnicode_AsWideCharString().

- Issue #7397: Mention that importlib.import_module() is probably what someone
  really wants to be using in __import__'s docstring.

- Issue #8521: Allow CreateKeyEx, OpenKeyEx, and DeleteKeyEx functions of winreg
  to use named arguments.

- Issue #9930: Remove bogus subtype check that was causing (e.g.)
  float.__rdiv__(2.0, 3) to return NotImplemented instead of the expected 1.5.

- Issue #9808: Implement os.getlogin for Windows. Patch by Jon Anglin.

- Issue #9901: Destroying the GIL in Py_Finalize() can fail if some other
  threads are still running.  Instead, reinitialize the GIL on a second call to
  Py_Initialize().

- All SyntaxErrors now have a column offset and therefore a caret when the error
  is printed.

- Issue #9252: PyImport_Import no longer uses a fromlist hack to return the
  module that was imported, but instead gets the module from sys.modules.

- Issue #9213: The range type_items now provides index() and count() methods, to
  conform to the Sequence ABC.  Patch by Daniel Urban and Daniel Stutzbach.

- Issue #7994: Issue a PendingDeprecationWarning if object.__format__ is called
  with a non-empty format string.  This is an effort to future-proof user
  code. If a derived class does not currently implement __format__ but later
  adds its own __format__, it would most likely break user code that had
  supplied a format string.  This will be changed to a DeprecationWaring in
  Python 3.3 and it will be an error in Python 3.4.

- Issue #9828: Destroy the GIL in Py_Finalize(), so that it gets properly
  re-created on a subsequent call to Py_Initialize().  The problem (a crash)
  wouldn't appear in 3.1 or 2.7 where the GIL's structure is more trivial.

- Issue #9210: Configure option --with-wctype-functions was removed.  Using the
  functions from the libc caused the methods .upper() and lower() to become
  locale aware and created subtly wrong results.

- Issue #9738: PyUnicode_FromFormat() and PyErr_Format() raise an error on a
  non-ASCII byte in the format string.

- Issue #4617: Previously it was illegal to delete a name from the local
  namespace if it occurs as a free variable in a nested block.  This limitation
  of the compiler has been lifted, and a new opcode introduced (DELETE_DEREF).

- Issue #9804: ascii() now always represents unicode surrogate pairs as a single
  ``\UXXXXXXXX``, regardless of whether the character is printable or not.
  Also, the "backslashreplace" error handler now joins surrogate pairs into a
  single character on UCS-2 builds.

- Issue #9757: memoryview objects get a release() method to release the
  underlying buffer (previously this was only done when deallocating the
  memoryview), and gain support for the context management protocol.

- Issue #9797: pystate.c wrongly assumed that zero couldn't be a valid
  thread-local storage key.

Library
-------

- Issue #2236: distutils' mkpath ignored the mode parameter.

- Fix typo in one sdist option (medata-check).

- Issue #9199: Fix incorrect use of distutils.cmd.Command.announce.

- Issue #1718574: Fix options that were supposed to accept arguments but did
  not in build_clib.

- Issue #9437: Fix building C extensions with non-default LDFLAGS.

- Issue #4661: email can now parse bytes input and generate either converted
  7bit output or bytes output.  Email version bumped to 5.1.0.

- Issue #1589: Add ssl.match_hostname(), to help implement server identity
  verification for higher-level protocols.

- Issue #9759: GzipFile now raises ValueError when an operation is attempted
  after the file is closed.  Patch by Jeffrey Finkelstein.

- Issue #9042: Fix interaction of custom translation classes and caching in
  gettext.

- Issue #6706: asyncore.dispatcher now provides a handle_accepted() method
  returning a (sock, addr) pair which is called when a connection has been
  established with a new remote endpoint.  This is supposed to be used as a
  replacement for old handle_accept() and avoids the user to call accept()
  directly.

- Issue #9065: tarfile no longer uses "root" as the default for the uname and
  gname field.

- Issue #8980: Fixed a failure in distutils.command check that was shadowed by
  an environment that does not have docutils.  Patch by Arfrever.

- Issue #1050268: parseaddr now correctly quotes double quote and backslash
  characters that appear inside quoted strings in email addresses.

- Issue #10004: quoprimime no longer generates a traceback when confronted with
  invalid characters after '=' in a Q-encoded word.

- Issue #1491: BaseHTTPServer nows send a ``100 Continue`` response before
  sending a 200 OK for the Expect: 100-continue request header.

- Issue #9360: Cleanup and improvements to the nntplib module.  The API now
  conforms to the philosophy of bytes and unicode separation in Python 3.  A
  test suite has also been added.

- Issue #9962: GzipFile now has the peek() method.

- Issue #9090: When a socket with a timeout fails with EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN,
  retry the select() loop instead of bailing out.  This is because select() can
  incorrectly report a socket as ready for reading (for example, if it received
  some data with an invalid checksum).

- Issue #3612: Added new types to ctypes.wintypes. (CHAR and pointers)

- Issue #9950: Fix socket.sendall() crash or misbehaviour when a signal is
  received.  Now sendall() properly calls signal handlers if necessary, and
  retries sending if these returned successfully, including on sockets with a
  timeout.

- Issue #9947: logging: Fixed locking bug in stopListening.

- Issue #9945: logging: Fixed locking bugs in addHandler/removeHandler.

- Issue #9936: Fixed executable lines' search in the trace module.

- Issue #9790: Rework imports necessary for samefile and sameopenfile
  in ntpath.

- Issue #9928: Properly initialize the types exported by the bz2 module.

- Issue #1675951: Allow GzipFile to work with unseekable file objects.  Patch by
  Florian Festi.

- Logging: Added QueueListener class to facilitate logging usage for
  performance-critical threads.

- Issue #9916: Add some missing errno symbols.

- Issue #9877: Expose sysconfig.get_makefile_filename()

- logging: Added hasHandlers() method to Logger and LoggerAdapter.

- Issue #9908: Fix os.stat() on bytes paths under Windows 7.

- Issue #2643: msync() is not called anymore when deallocating an open mmap
  object, only munmap().

- logging: Changed LoggerAdapter implementation internally, to make it easier to
  subclass in a useful way.

- logging: hasHandlers method was added to Logger, and isEnabledFor,
  getEffectiveLevel, hasHandlers and setLevel were added to LoggerAdapter.
  LoggerAdapter was introduced into the unit tests for logging.

- Issue #1686: Fix string.Template when overriding the pattern attribute.

- Issue #9854: SocketIO objects now observe the RawIOBase interface in
  non-blocking mode: they return None when an operation would block (instead of
  raising an exception).

- Issue #1730136: Fix the comparison between a tk.font.Font and an object of
  another kind.

- Issue #9441: logging has better coverage for rotating file handlers.

- Issue #9865: collections.OrderedDict now has a __sizeof__ method.

- Issue #9854: The default read() implementation in io.RawIOBase now handles
  non-blocking readinto() returning None correctly.

- Issue #1552: socket.socketpair() now returns regular socket.socket objects
  supporting the whole socket API (rather than the "raw" _socket.socket
  objects).

- Issue #9853: Fix the signature of SSLSocket.recvfrom() and SSLSocket.sendto()
  to match the corresponding socket methods.

- Issue #9840: Added a decorator to reprlib for wrapping __repr__ methods to make
  them handle recursive calls within the same thread.

- logging: Enhanced HTTPHandler with secure and credentials initializers.

- Issue #767645: Set os.path.supports_unicode_filenames to True on Mac OS X.

- Issue #9837: The read() method of ZipExtFile objects (as returned by
  ZipFile.open()) could return more bytes than requested.

- Issue #9826: OrderedDict.__repr__ can now handle self-referential values:
  d['x'] = d.

- Issue #9825: Using __del__ in the definition of collections.OrderedDict made
  it possible for the user to create self-referencing ordered dictionaries which
  become permanently uncollectable GC garbage.  Reinstated the Python 3.1
  approach of using weakref proxies so that reference cycles never get created
  in the first place.

- Issue #9579, #9580: Fix os.confstr() for value longer than 255 bytes and
  encode the value with filesystem encoding and surrogateescape (instead of
  utf-8 in strict mode) . Patch written by David Watson.

- Issue #9632: Remove sys.setfilesystemencoding() function: use PYTHONFSENCODING
  environment variable to set the filesystem encoding at Python startup.
  sys.setfilesystemencoding() creates inconsistencies because it is unable to
  reencode all filenames in all objects.

- Issue #9410: Various optimizations to the pickle module, leading to speedups
  up to 4x (depending on the benchmark).  Mostly ported from Unladen Swallow;
  initial patch by Alexandre Vassalotti.

- The pprint module now supports printing OrderedDicts in their given order
  (formerly, it would sort the keys).

- Logging: Added QueueHandler class to facilitate logging usage with
  multiprocessing.

- Issue #9707: Rewritten reference implementation of threading.local which is
  friendlier towards reference cycles.  This change is not normally visible
  since an optimized C implementation (_thread._local) is used instead.

- Issue #6394: os.getppid() is now supported on Windows.  Note that it will
  still return the id of the parent process after it has exited.  This process
  id may even have been reused by another unrelated process.

- Issue #9792: In case of connection failure, socket.create_connection() would
  swallow the exception and raise a new one, making it impossible to fetch the
  original errno, or to filter timeout errors.  Now the original error is
  re-raised.

- Issue #9758: When fcntl.ioctl() was called with mutable_flag set to True, and
  the passed buffer was exactly 1024 bytes long, the buffer wouldn't be updated
  back after the system call.  Original patch by Brian Brazil.

- Updates to the random module:

  * Document which parts of the module are guaranteed to stay the same across
    versions and which parts are subject to change.

  * Update the seed() method to use all of the bits in a string instead of just
    the hash value.  This makes better use of the seed value and assures the
    seeding is platform independent.  Issue #7889.

  * Improved the random()-->integer algorithm used in choice(), shuffle(),
    sample(), randrange(), and randint().  Formerly, it used int(n*random())
    which has a slight bias whenever n is not a power of two.  Issue #9025.

  * Improved documentation of arguments to randrange().  Issue #9379.

- collections.OrderedDict now supports a new method for repositioning keys to
  either end.

- Issue #9754: Similarly to assertRaises and assertRaisesRegexp, unittest test
  cases now also have assertWarns and assertWarnsRegexp methods to check that a
  given warning type was triggered by the code under test.

- Issue #5506: BytesIO objects now have a getbuffer() method exporting a view of
  their contents without duplicating them.  The view is both readable and
  writable.

- Issue #7566: Implement os.path.sameopenfile for Windows.

- Issue #9293: I/O streams now raise ``io.UnsupportedOperation`` when an
  unsupported operation is attempted (for example, writing to a file open only
  for reading).

- hashlib has two new constant attributes: algorithms_guaranteed and
  algorithms_avaiable that respectively list the names of hash algorithms
  guaranteed to exist in all Python implementations and the names of hash
  algorithms available in the current process.

- A new package ``concurrent.futures`` as defined by PEP 3148.

C-API
-----

- Add PyErr_SyntaxLocationEx, which supports passing a column offset.

- Issue #9834: Don't segfault in PySequence_GetSlice, PySequence_SetSlice, or
  PySequence_DelSlice when the object doesn't have any mapping operations
  defined.

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 05-Sep-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #9225: Remove the ROT_FOUR and DUP_TOPX opcode, the latter replaced by
  the new (and simpler) DUP_TOP_TWO.  Performance isn't changed, but our
  bytecode is a bit simplified.  Patch by Demur Rumed.

- Issue #9766: Rename poorly named variables exposed by _warnings to prevent
  confusion with the proper variables names from 'warnings' itself.

- Issue #9212: dict_keys and dict_items now provide the isdisjoint() method, to
  conform to the Set ABC.  Patch by Daniel Urban.

- Issue #9737: Fix a crash when trying to delete a slice or an item from a
  memoryview object.

- Issue #9549: sys.setdefaultencoding() and PyUnicode_SetDefaultEncoding() are
  now removed, since their effect was inexistent in 3.x (the default encoding is
  hardcoded to utf-8 and cannot be changed).

- Issue #7415: PyUnicode_FromEncodedObject() now uses the new buffer API
  properly.  Patch by Stefan Behnel.

- Issue #5553: The Py_LOCAL_INLINE macro now results in inlining on most
  platforms.  Previously, it inlined only when using Microsoft Visual C.

- Issue #9712: Fix tokenize on identifiers that start with non-ascii names.

- Issue #9688: __basicsize__ and __itemsize__ must be accessed as Py_ssize_t.

- Issue #9684: Added a definition for SIZEOF_WCHAR_T to PC/pyconfig.h, to match
  the pyconfig.h generated by configure on other systems.

- Issue #9666: Only catch AttributeError in hasattr(). All other exceptions that
  occur during attribute lookup are now propagated to the caller.

- Issue #8622: Add PYTHONFSENCODING environment variable to override the
  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #5127: The C functions that access the Unicode Database now accept and
  return characters from the full Unicode range, even on narrow unicode builds
  (Py_UNICODE_TOLOWER, Py_UNICODE_ISDECIMAL, and others).  A visible difference
  in Python is that unicodedata.numeric() now returns the correct value for
  large code points, and repr() may consider more characters as printable.

- Issue #9425: Create PyModule_GetFilenameObject() function to get the filename
  as a unicode object, instead of a byte string. Function needed to support
  unencodable filenames. Deprecate PyModule_GetFilename() in favor on the new
  function.

- Issue #8063: Call _PyGILState_Init() earlier in Py_InitializeEx().

- Issue #9612: The set object is now 64-bit clean under Windows.

- Issue #8202: sys.argv[0] is now set to '-m' instead of '-c' when searching for
  the module file to be executed with the -m command line option.

- Issue #9599: Create PySys_FormatStdout() and PySys_FormatStderr() functions to
  write a message formatted by PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to sys.stdout and
  sys.stderr.

- Issue #9542: Create PyUnicode_FSDecoder() function, a ParseTuple converter:
  decode bytes objects to unicode using PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize(); str
  objects are output as-is.

- Issue #9203: Computed gotos are now enabled by default on supported compilers
  (which are detected by the configure script).  They can still be disable
  selectively by specifying --without-computed-gotos.

- Issue #9425: Create PyErr_WarnFormat() function, similar to PyErr_WarnEx() but
  use PyUnicode_FromFormatV() to format the warning message.

- Issue #8530: Prevent stringlib fastsearch from reading beyond the front of an
  array.

- Issue #5319: Print an error if flushing stdout fails at interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #9337: The str() of a float or complex number is now identical to its
  repr().

- Issue #9416: Fix some issues with complex formatting where the output with no
  type specifier failed to match the str output:

    - format(complex(-0.0, 2.0), '-') omitted the real part from the output,
    - format(complex(0.0, 2.0), '-') included a sign and parentheses.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #8013: time.asctime and time.ctime no longer call system
  asctime and ctime functions.  The year range for time.asctime is now
  1900 through maxint.  The range for time.ctime is the same as for
  time.localtime.  The string produced by these functions is longer
  than 24 characters when year is greater than 9999.

- Issue #6608: time.asctime is now checking struct tm fields its input
  before passing it to the system asctime.  Patch by MunSic Jeong.

- Issue #8734: Avoid crash in msvcrt.get_osfhandle() when an invalid file
  descriptor is provided.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

  socket module, and fix the width of socket descriptors to be correctly
  detected under 64-bit Windows.

- Issue #1027206: Support IDNA in gethostbyname, gethostbyname_ex, getaddrinfo
  and gethostbyaddr.  getnameinfo is now restricted to numeric addresses as
  input.

- Issue #9214: Set operations on a KeysView or ItemsView in collections now
  correctly return a set.  Patch by Eli Bendersky.

- Issue #5737: Add Solaris-specific mnemonics in the errno module.  Patch by
  Matthew Ahrens.

- Restore GIL in nis_cat in case of error. Decode NIS data to fs encoding, using
  the surrogate error handler.

  than ``TypeError`` raised by the iterator argument.

- Issue #9570: Use PEP 383 decoding in os.mknod and os.mkfifo.

- Fix memory leak in ssl._ssl._test_decode_cert.

- Issue #8065: Fix memory leak in readline module (from failure to free the
  result of history_get_history_state()).

- Issue #9450: Fix memory leak in readline.replace_history_item and
  readline.remove_history_item for readline version >= 5.0.

- Issue #8105: Validate file descriptor passed to mmap.mmap on Windows.

- Issue #8046: Add context manager protocol support and .closed property to mmap
  objects.

- Issue #3488: Provide convenient shorthand functions ``gzip.compress`` and
  ``gzip.decompress``.  Original patch by Anand B. Pillai.

- Issue #8807: poplib.POP3_SSL class now accepts a context parameter, which is a

  single keyword arguments.

- Address XXX comment in dis.py by having inspect.py prefer to reuse the dis.py

- Issue #9603: posix.ttyname() and posix.ctermid() decode the terminal name
  using the filesystem encoding and surrogateescape error handler. Patch written
  by David Watson.

- Issue #7647: The posix module now has the ST_RDONLY and ST_NOSUID constants,
  for use with the statvfs() function.  Patch by Adam Jackson.

- Issue #8688: MANIFEST files created by distutils now include a magic comment
  indicating they are generated.  Manually maintained MANIFESTs without this
  marker will not be overwritten or removed.

- Issue #7467: when reading a file from a ZIP archive, its CRC is checked and a
  BadZipfile error is raised if it doesn't match (as used to be the case in
  Python 2.5 and earlier).

- Issue #9550: a BufferedReader could issue an additional read when the original
  read request had been satisfied, which could block indefinitely when the
  underlying raw IO channel was e.g. a socket.  Report and original patch by
  Jason V. Miller.

- Issue #3757: thread-local objects now support cyclic garbage collection.
  Thread-local objects involved in reference cycles will be deallocated timely

  was wrong.

- Issue #6683: For SMTP logins we now try all authentication methods advertised
  by the server.  Many servers are buggy and advertise authentication methods
  they do not support in reality.

- Issue #8814: function annotations (the ``__annotations__`` attribute) are now

What's New in Python 3.2 Alpha 1?
=================================

*Release date: 01-Aug-2010*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #8991: convertbuffer() rejects discontigious buffers.

- Issue #7616: Fix copying of overlapping memoryview slices with the Intel
  compiler.

- Issue #8413: structsequence now subclasses tuple.

- Issue #8271: during the decoding of an invalid UTF-8 byte sequence, only the
  start byte and the continuation byte(s) are now considered invalid, instead of
  the number of bytes specified by the start byte.  E.g.:
  '\xf1\x80AB'.decode('utf-8', 'replace') now returns u'\ufffdAB' and replaces
  with U+FFFD only the start byte ('\xf1') and the continuation byte ('\x80')
  even if '\xf1' is the start byte of a 4-bytes sequence.  Previous versions
  returned a single u'\ufffd'.

- Issue #9011: A negated imaginary literal (e.g., "-7j") now has real part -0.0
  rather than 0.0.  So "-7j" is now exactly equivalent to "-(7j)".

- Be more specific in error messages about positional arguments.

- Issue #8949: "z" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions doesn't accept bytes
  objects, as described in the documentation.

- Issue #6543: Write the traceback in the terminal encoding instead of utf-8.
  Fix the encoding of the modules filename.  Patch written by Amaury Forgeot
  d'Arc.

- Issue #9011: Remove buggy and unnecessary (in 3.x) ST->AST compilation code
  dealing with unary minus applied to a constant.  The removed code was mutating
  the ST, causing a second compilation to fail.

- Issue #850997: mbcs encoding (Windows only) handles errors argument: strict
  mode raises unicode errors.  The encoder only supports "strict" and "replace"
  error handlers, the decoder only supports "strict" and "ignore" error
  handlers.  Patch written by Mark Hammond.

- Issue #8850: Remove "w" and "w#" formats from PyArg_Parse*() functions, use
  "w*" format instead. Add tests for "w*" format.

- Issue #8592: PyArg_Parse*() functions raise a TypeError for "y", "u" and "Z"
  formats if the string contains a null byte/character.  Write unit tests for
  string formats.

- Issue #7490: To facilitate sharing of doctests between 2.x and 3.x test
  suites, the IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL directive now also ignores the module
  location of the raised exception.

- Issue #8969: On Windows, use mbcs codec in strict mode to encode and decode
  filenames and enable os.fsencode().

- Issue #9058: Remove assertions about INT_MAX in UnicodeDecodeError.

- Issue #8941: Decoding big endian UTF-32 data in UCS-2 builds could crash the
  interpreter with characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (higher than
  0x10000).

- Issue #8950: (See also issue #5080).  Py_ArgParse*() functions now raise
  TypeError instead of giving a DeprecationWarning when a float is parsed using
  the 'L' code (for long long).  (All other integer codes already raise
  TypeError in this case.)

- Issue #8922: Normalize the encoding name in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() to
  enable shortcuts for upper case encoding name. Add also a shortcut for
  "iso-8859-1" in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() and PyUnicode_Decode().

- Issue #8838: Remove codecs.charbuffer_encode() function.  The buffer protocol
  doesn't support "char buffer" anymore in Python 3.

- Issue #8339: Remove "t#" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions, use "s#" or "s*"
  instead.  codecs.charbuffer_encode() now accepts modifiable buffer objects
  like bytearray.

- Issue #8837: Remove "O?" format of PyArg_Parse*() functions.  The format is no
  used anymore and it was never documented.

- In str.format(), raise a ValueError when indexes to arguments are too large.

- Issue #2844: Make int('42', n) consistently raise ValueError for invalid
  integers n (including n = -909).

- Issue #8188: Introduce a new scheme for computing hashes of numbers (instances
  of int, float, complex, decimal.Decimal and fractions.Fraction) that makes it
  easy to maintain the invariant that hash(x) == hash(y) whenever x and y have
  equal value.

- Issue #8748: Fix two issues with comparisons between complex and integer
  objects.  (1) The comparison could incorrectly return True in some cases
  (2**53+1 == complex(2**53) == 2**53), breaking transitivity of equality.
  (2) The comparison raised an OverflowError for large integers, leading to
  unpredictable exceptions when combining integers and complex objects in sets
  or dicts.

- Issue #8766: Initialize _warnings module before importing the first module.
  Fix a crash if an empty directory called "encodings" exists in sys.path.

- Issue #8589: Decode PYTHONWARNINGS environment variable with the file system
  encoding and surrogateescape error handler instead of the locale encoding to
  be consistent with os.environ.  Add PySys_AddWarnOptionUnicode() function.

- PyObject_Dump() encodes unicode objects to utf8 with backslashreplace (instead
  of strict) error handler to escape surrogates.

- Issue #8715: Create PyUnicode_EncodeFSDefault() function: Encode a Unicode
  object to Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding with the "surrogateescape" error
  handler, and return bytes.  If Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding is not set, fall
  back to UTF-8.

- Enable shortcuts for common encodings in PyUnicode_AsEncodedString() for any
  error handler, not only the default error handler (strict).

- Issue #8610: Load file system codec at startup, and display a fatal error on
  failure.  Set the file system encoding to utf-8 (instead of None) if getting
  the locale encoding failed, or if nl_langinfo(CODESET) function is missing.

- PyFile_FromFd() uses PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefault() instead of
  PyUnicode_FromString() to support surrogates in the filename and use the right
  encoding.

- Issue #7507: Quote "!" in pipes.quote(); it is special to some shells.

- PyUnicode_DecodeFSDefaultAndSize() uses surrogateescape error handler.

- Issue #8419: Prevent the dict constructor from accepting non-string keyword
  arguments.

- Issue #8124: PySys_WriteStdout() and PySys_WriteStderr() don't execute
  indirectly Python signal handlers anymore because mywrite() ignores exceptions
  (KeyboardInterrupt).

- Issue #8092: Fix PyUnicode_EncodeUTF8() to support error handler producing
  unicode string (eg. backslashreplace).

- Issue #8485: PyUnicode_FSConverter() doesn't accept byteearray objects
  anymore, you have to convert your bytearray filenames to bytes.

- Issue #7332: Remove the 16KB stack-based buffer in
  PyMarshal_ReadLastObjectFromFile, which doesn't bring any noticeable benefit
  compared to the dynamic memory allocation fallback.  Patch by Charles-François
  Natali.

- Issue #8417: Raise an OverflowError when an integer larger than sys.maxsize is
  passed to bytes or bytearray.

- Issue #7301: Add environment variable $PYTHONWARNINGS.

- Issue #8329: Don't return the same lists from select.select when no fds are
  changed.

- Issue #8259: 1L << (2**31) no longer produces an 'outrageous shift error' on
  64-bit machines.  The shift count for either left or right shift is permitted
  to be up to sys.maxsize.

- Ensure that tokenization of identifiers is not affected by locale.

- Issue #1222585: Added LDCXXSHARED for C++ support. Patch by Arfrever.

- Raise a TypeError when trying to delete a T_STRING_INPLACE struct member.

- Issue #8211: Save/restore CFLAGS around AC_PROG_CC in configure.in, in case it
  is set.

- Issue #8226: sys.setfilesystemencoding() raises a LookupError if the encoding
  is unknown.

- Issue #1583863: A str subclass can now override the __str__ method.

- Issue #8014: Setting a T_UINT or T_PYSSIZET attribute of an object with
  PyMemberDefs could produce an internal error; raise TypeError instead.

- Issue #7845: Rich comparison methods on the complex type now return
  NotImplemented rather than raising a TypeError when comparing with an
  incompatible type; this allows user-defined classes to implement their own
  comparisons with complex.

- Issue #3137: Don't ignore errors at startup, especially a keyboard interrupt
  (SIGINT). If an error occurs while importing the site module, the error is
  printed and Python exits. Initialize the GIL before importing the site module.

- Issue #7173: Generator finalization could invalidate sys.exc_info().

- Issue #7544: Preallocate thread memory before creating the thread to avoid a
  fatal error in low memory condition.

- Issue #7820: The parser tokenizer restores all bytes in the right if the BOM
  check fails.

- Handle errors from looking up __prepare__ correctly.

- Issue #5939: Add additional runtime checking to ensure a valid capsule in
  Modules/_ctypes/callproc.c.

- Issue #7309: Fix unchecked attribute access when converting
  UnicodeEncodeError, UnicodeDecodeError, and UnicodeTranslateError to strings.

- Issue #6902: Fix problem with built-in types format incorrectly with 0
  padding.

- Issue #7988: Fix default alignment to be right aligned for complex.__format__.
  Now it matches other numeric types.

- Issue #5988: Remove deprecated functions PyOS_ascii_formatd,
  PyOS_ascii_strtod, and PyOS_ascii_atof.  Use PyOS_double_to_string and
  PyOS_string_to_double instead.  See issue #5835 for the original deprecations.

- Issue #7385: Fix a crash in `MemoryView_FromObject` when `PyObject_GetBuffer`
  fails.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7788: Fix an interpreter crash produced by deleting a list slice with
  very large step value.

- Issue #7766: Change sys.getwindowsversion() return value to a named tuple and
  add the additional members returned in an OSVERSIONINFOEX structure.  The new
  members are service_pack_major, service_pack_minor, suite_mask, and
  product_type.

- Issue #7561: Operations on empty bytearrays (such as `int(bytearray())`) could
  crash in many places because of the PyByteArray_AS_STRING() macro returning
  NULL.  The macro now returns a statically allocated empty string instead.

- Issue #6690: Optimize the bytecode for expressions such as `x in {1, 2, 3}`,
  where the right hand operand is a set of constants, by turning the set into a
  frozenset and pre-building it as a constant.  The comparison operation is made
  against the constant instead of building a new set each time it is executed (a
  similar optimization already existed which turned a list of constants into a
  pre-built tuple).  Patch and additional tests by Dave Malcolm.

- Issue #7622: Improve the split(), rsplit(), splitlines() and replace() methods
  of bytes, bytearray and unicode objects by using a common implementation based
  on stringlib's fast search.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7632: Fix various str -> float conversion bugs present in 2.7 alpha 2,
  including: (1) a serious 'wrong output' bug that could occur for long (> 40
  digit) input strings, (2) a crash in dtoa.c that occurred in debug builds when
  parsing certain long numeric strings corresponding to subnormal values, (3) a
  memory leak for some values large enough to cause overflow, and (4) a number
  of flaws that could lead to incorrectly rounded results.

- The __complex__ method is now looked up on the class of instances to make it
  consistent with other special methods.

- Issue #7462: Implement the stringlib fast search algorithm for the `rfind`,
  `rindex`, `rsplit` and `rpartition` methods.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7604: Deleting an unset slotted attribute did not raise an
  AttributeError.

- Issue #7534: Fix handling of IEEE specials (infinities, nans, negative zero)
  in ** operator.  The behaviour now conforms to that described in C99 Annex F.

- Issue #1811: improve accuracy and cross-platform consistency for true division
  of integers: the result of a/b is now correctly rounded for ints a and b (at
  least on IEEE 754 platforms), and in particular does not depend on the
  internal representation of an int.

- Issue #6834: replace the implementation for the 'python' and 'pythonw'
  executables on OSX.

  These executables now work properly with the arch(1) command: ``arch -ppc
  python`` will start a universal binary version of python in PPC mode (unlike
  previous releases).

- Issue #7466: Segmentation fault when the garbage collector is called in the
  middle of populating a tuple.  Patch by Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #6970: Remove redundant calls when comparing objects that don't
  implement the relevant rich comparison methods.

- Issue #7298: Fixes for range and reversed(range(...)).  Iteration over
  range(a, b, c) incorrectly gave an empty iterator when a, b and c fit in C
  long but the length of the range did not.  Also fix several cases where
  reversed(range(a, b, c)) gave wrong results, and fix a refleak for
  reversed(range(a, b, c)) with large arguments.

- Issue #7244: itertools.izip_longest() no longer ignores exceptions raised
  during the formation of an output tuple.

- Issue #3297: On wide unicode builds, do not split unicode characters into
  surrogates.

- Remove length limitation when constructing a complex number from a string.

- Issue #1087418: Boost performance of bitwise operations for longs.

- Support for AtheOS has been completely removed from the code base. It was
  disabled since Python 3.0.

- Support for several legacy threading libraries has been disabled. These
  libraries are: Mach C threads, SunOS LWP, GNU pth, Irix threads. Support code
  will be entirely removed in 3.3.

- Support for OSF* has been disabled. If nobody stands up, support will be
  removed in 3.3. See <http://bugs.python.org/issue8606>.

- Peephole constant folding had missed UNARY_POSITIVE.

  breaks are now generated from the official Unicode Character Database files,
  and include information from the Unihan.txt file.

- Issue #7019: Raise ValueError when unmarshalling bad long data, instead of
  producing internally inconsistent Python longs.

- Issue #6990: Fix threading.local subclasses leaving old state around after a

  and not an int.  Fix the corresponding error message, and the documentation.

- The deprecated PyCObject has been removed.

- Issue #6347: Include inttypes.h as well as stdint.h in pyport.h.  This fixes a
  build failure on HP-UX: int32_t and uint32_t are defined in inttypes.h instead
  of stdint.h on that platform.

- Issue #6373: Fixed a SystemError when encoding with the latin-1 codec and the
  'surrogateescape' error handler, a string which contains unpaired surrogates.

- Issue #4856: Remove checks for win NT.

- Issue #6687: PyBytes_FromObject() no longer accepts an integer as its argument
  to construct a null-initialized bytes object.

- Issue #1023290: Add from_bytes() and to_bytes() methods to integers.  These

  "~/Library/Python/2.7" instead of "~/.local".

C-API
-----

- Issue #2443: A new macro, `Py_VA_COPY`, copies the state of the
  variable argument list.  `Py_VA_COPY` is equivalent to C99
  `va_copy`, but available on all python platforms.

- PySlice_GetIndicesEx now clips the step to [-PY_SSIZE_T_MAX, PY_SSIZE_T_MAX]
  instead of [-PY_SSIZE_T_MAX-1, PY_SSIZE_T_MAX].  This makes it safe to do
  "step = -step" when reversing a slice.

- Issue #5753: A new C API function, `PySys_SetArgvEx`, allows embedders of the
  interpreter to set sys.argv without also modifying sys.path.  This helps fix
  `CVE-2008-5983
  <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5983>`_.

- Add PyArg_ValidateKeywordArguments, which checks if all keyword arguments are
  strings in an efficient manner.

- Issue #8276: PyEval_CallObject() is now only available in macro form.  The
  function declaration, which was kept for backwards compatibility reasons, is
  now removed (the macro was introduced in 1997!).

- Issue #7767: New function PyLong_AsLongLongAndOverflow added, analogous to
  PyLong_AsLongAndOverflow.

- Make PyUnicode_CompareWithASCIIString return not equal if the Python string
  has '\0' at the end.

- Issue #5080: The argument parsing functions PyArg_ParseTuple,
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords, PyArg_VaParse, PyArg_VaParseTupleAndKeywords and
  PyArg_Parse now raise a DeprecationWarning for float arguments passed with the
  'L' format code.  This will become a TypeError in a future version of Python,
  to match the behaviour of the other integer format codes.

- Issue #7033: Function ``PyErr_NewExceptionWithDoc()`` added.

- Issue #7414: 'C' code wasn't being skipped properly (for keyword arguments) in
  PyArg_ParseTupleAndKeywords.

- Issue #7228: Add '%lld' and '%llu' support to PyString_FromFormat(V) and
  PyErr_Format, on machines with HAVE_LONG_LONG defined.

- Issue #6151: Made PyDescr_COMMON conform to standard C (like PyObject_HEAD in
  PEP 3123).  The PyDescr_TYPE and PyDescr_NAME macros should be should used for
  accessing the d_type and d_name members of structures using PyDescr_COMMON.

- Issue #6405: Remove duplicate type declarations in descrobject.h.

- The code flags for old __future__ features are now available again.

- Issue #5954: Add a PyFrame_GetLineNumber() function to replace most uses of
  PyCode_Addr2Line().

- Issue #5959: Add a PyCode_NewEmpty() function to create a new empty code
  object at a specified file, function, and line number.

- Issue #1419652: Change the first argument to PyImport_AppendInittab() to
  ``const char *`` as the string is stored beyond the call.

- Issue #2422: When compiled with the ``--with-valgrind`` option, the pymalloc
  allocator will be automatically disabled when running under Valgrind.  This
  gives improved memory leak detection when running under Valgrind, while taking
  advantage of pymalloc at other times.

Library
-------

- In pdb, when Ctrl-C is entered while defining commands for a breakpoint, the
  old commands are restored.

- For traceback debugging, the pdb listing now also shows the locations where
  the exception was originally (re)raised, if it differs from the last line
  executed (e.g. in case of finally clauses).

- The pdb command "source" has been added.  It displays the source code for a
  given object, if possible.

- The pdb command "longlist" has been added.  It displays the whole source code
  for the current function.

- Issue #1503502: Make pdb.Pdb easier to subclass by putting message and error
  output into methods.

- Issue #9384: ``python -m tkinter`` will now display a simple demo applet.

- The default size of the re module's compiled regular expression cache has been
  increased from 100 to 500 and the cache replacement policy has changed from
  simply clearing the entire cache on overflow to forgetting the least recently
  used cached compiled regular expressions.  This is a performance win for
  applications that use a lot of regular expressions and limits the impact of
  the performance hit anytime the cache is exceeded.

- Issue #7113: Speed up loading in configparser. Patch by Łukasz Langa.

- Issue #9032: XML-RPC client retries the request on EPIPE error.  The EPIPE
  error occurs when the server closes the socket and the client sends a big

  getopt doesn't accept a value (eg. --help= is rejected if getopt uses
  ['help='] long options).

- Issue #7989: Added pure python implementation of the `datetime` module.  The C
  module is renamed to `_datetime` and if available, overrides all classes
  defined in datetime with fast C impementation.  Python implementation is based
  on the original python prototype for the datetime module by Tim Peters with
  minor modifications by the PyPy project.  The test suite now tests `datetime`
  module with and without `_datetime` acceleration using the same test cases.

- Issue #7895: platform.mac_ver() no longer crashes after calling os.fork().

  and the exponent is tiny (for example, ``Decimal(10) **
  Decimal('1e-999999999')``).

  giving the number of frames to go.

- Issue #9018: os.path.normcase() now raises a TypeError if the argument is not
  ``str`` or ``bytes``.

- Issue #9075: In the ssl module, remove the setting of a ``debug`` flag on an
  OpenSSL structure.

- Issue #8682: The ssl module now temporary increments the reference count of a
  socket object got through ``PyWeakref_GetObject``, so as to avoid possible
  deallocation while the object is still being used.

- Issue #1368368: FancyURLOpener class changed to throw an Exception on wrong
  password instead of presenting an interactive prompt.  Older behavior can be
  obtained by passing retry=True to http_error_xxx methods of FancyURLOpener.

- Issue #8720: Fix regression caused by fix for #4050 by making getsourcefile
  smart enough to find source files in the linecache.

- Issue #5610: feedparser no longer eats extra characters at the end of a body
  part if the body part ends with a ``\r\n``.

  between -27.3 and -30.0 on some platforms.

- Issue #8784: Set tarfile default encoding to 'utf-8' on Windows.

- Issue #8966: If a ctypes structure field is an array of c_char, convert its
  value to bytes instead of str (as done for c_char and c_char_p).

- Issue #8188: Comparisons between Decimal and Fraction objects are now
  permitted, returning a result based on the exact numerical values of the
  operands.  This builds on issue #2531, which allowed Decimal-to-float
  comparisons; all comparisons involving numeric types (bool, int, float,
  complex, Decimal, Fraction) should now act as expected.

  and sys.stdout.buffer (instead of sys.stdin and sys.stdout) to use the bytes
  API.

- Issue #8770: Now sysconfig displays information when it's called as a script.
  Initial idea by Sridhar Ratnakumar.

- Issue #6662: Fix parsing of malformatted charref (&#bad;), patch written by
  Fredrik Håård.

- Issue #8540: Decimal module: rename the Context._clamp attribute to
  Context.clamp and make it public.  This is useful in creating contexts that
  correspond to the decimal interchange formats specified in IEEE 754.

- Issue #6268: Fix seek() method of codecs.open(), don't read or write the BOM
  twice after seek(0). Fix also reset() method of codecs, UTF-16, UTF-32 and
  StreamWriter classes.

  stdout is not a TTY).

- Issue #8513: os.get_exec_path() supports b'PATH' key and bytes value.
  subprocess.Popen() and os._execvpe() support bytes program name. Add

  for use in the file system, environment variables or the command line.

- Issue #8571: Fix an internal error when compressing or decompressing a chunk
  larger than 1GB with the zlib module's compressor and decompressor objects.

- Issue #8603: Support bytes environmental variables on Unix: Add os.environb
  mapping and os.getenvb() function. os.unsetenv() encodes str argument to the
  file system encoding with the surrogateescape error handler (instead of
  utf8/strict) and accepts bytes. posix.environ keys and values are now bytes.

- Issue #8573: asyncore _strerror() function might throw ValueError.

- Issue #8483: asyncore.dispatcher's __getattr__ method produced confusing error
  messages when accessing undefined class attributes because of the cheap
  inheritance with the underlying socket object.  The cheap inheritance has been
  deprecated.

- Issue #4265: shutil.copyfile() was leaking file descriptors when disk fills.
  Patch by Tres Seaver.

- Issue #8390: tarfile uses surrogateescape as the default error handler
  (instead of replace in read mode or strict in write mode).

- Issue #7755: Use an unencumbered audio file for tests.

- Issue #8621: uuid.uuid4() returned the same sequence of values in the parent
  and any children created using ``os.fork`` on MacOS X 10.6.

  trapped, the specification determines the order in which the signals should be
  handled.  In many cases this order wasn't being followed, leading to the wrong
  Python exception being raised.

  the method could block indefinitely if called just before the event loop
  started running.  This also fixes the occasional freezes witnessed in
  test_httpservers.

- Issue #8524: When creating an SSL socket, the timeout value of the original
  socket wasn't retained (instead, a socket with a positive timeout would be
  turned into a non-blocking SSL socket).

- Issue #5103: SSL handshake would ignore the socket timeout and block
  indefinitely if the other end didn't respond.

- The do_handshake() method of SSL objects now adjusts the blocking mode of the
  SSL structure if necessary (as other methods already do).

- Issue #8391: os.execvpe() and os.getenv() supports unicode with surrogates and
  bytes strings for environment keys and values.

- Issue #8467: Pure Python implementation of subprocess encodes the error
  message using surrogatepass error handler to support surrogates in the
  message.

- Issue #8468: bz2.BZ2File() accepts str with surrogates and bytes filenames.

- Issue #8451: Syslog module now uses basename(sys.argv[0]) instead of the
  string "python" as the *ident*.  openlog() arguments are all optional and
  keywords.

- Issue #8108: Fix the unwrap() method of SSL objects when the socket has a
  non-infinite timeout.  Also make that method friendlier with applications
  wanting to continue using the socket in clear-text mode, by disabling
  OpenSSL's internal readahead.  Thanks to Darryl Miles for guidance.

- Issue #8496: make mailcap.lookup() always return a list, rather than an
  iterator.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

  collation name contains a surrogate character.

- Issue #8484: Load all ciphers and digest algorithms when initializing the _ssl
  extension, such that verification of some SSL certificates doesn't fail
  because of an "unknown algorithm".

- Issue #6547: Added the ignore_dangling_symlinks option to shutil.copytree.

- Issue #7316: The acquire() method of lock objects in the :mod:`threading`
  module now takes an optional timeout argument in seconds.  Timeout support
  relies on the system threading library, so as to avoid a semi-busy wait loop.

- Issue #8383: pickle and pickletools use surrogatepass error handler when
  encoding unicode as utf8 to support lone surrogates and stay compatible with
  Python 2.x and 3.x.

- Issue #7585: difflib context and unified diffs now place a tab between
  filename and date, conforming to the 'standards' they were originally designed
  to follow.  This improves compatibility with patch tools.

  using the new attributes `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION`, `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_INFO` and
  `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.

- Add functools.total_ordering() and functools.cmp_to_key().

- Issue #8257: The Decimal construct now accepts a float instance directly,
  converting that float to a Decimal of equal value:

     >>> Decimal(1.1)
     Decimal('1.100000000000000088817841970012523233890533447265625')

- Issue #8294: The Fraction constructor now accepts Decimal and float instances
  directly.

- Issue #7279: Comparisons involving a Decimal signaling NaN now signal
  InvalidOperation instead of returning False.  (Comparisons involving a quiet
  NaN are unchanged.)  Also, Decimal quiet NaNs are now hashable; Decimal
  signaling NaNs remain unhashable.

- Issue #2531: Comparison operations between floats and Decimal instances now
  return a result based on the numeric values of the operands; previously they
  returned an arbitrary result based on the relative ordering of id(float) and
  id(Decimal).  See also issue #8188, which adds Decimal-to-Fraction
  comparisons.

- Added a subtract() method to collections.Counter().

- Issue #8233: When run as a script, py_compile.py optionally takes a single
  argument `-` which tells it to read files to compile from stdin.  Each line is
  read on demand and the named file is compiled immediately.  (Original patch by
  Piotr Ożarowski).

- Backwards incompatible change: Unicode codepoints line tabulation (0x0B) and
  form feed (0x0C) are now considered linebreaks, as specified in Unicode
  Standard Annex #14.  See issue #7643.  http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/

- Comparisons using one of <, <=, >, >= between a complex instance and a
  Fractions instance now raise TypeError instead of returning True/False.  This
  makes Fraction <=> complex comparisons consistent with int <=> complex, float
  <=> complex, and complex <=> complex comparisons.

- Issue #8139: ossaudiodev didn't initialize its types properly, therefore some
  methods (such as oss_mixer_device.fileno()) were not available.  Initial patch
  by Bertrand Janin.

- Issue #8205: Remove the "Modules" directory from sys.path when Python is
  running from the build directory (POSIX only).

- Issue #7512: shutil.copystat() could raise an OSError when the filesystem
  didn't support chflags() (for example ZFS under FreeBSD).  The error is now
  silenced.

  is running in WOW64 mode on 64 bit Windows.

- Issue #3890, #8222: Fix recv() and recv_into() on non-blocking SSL sockets.
  Also, enable the SSL_MODE_AUTO_RETRY flag on SSL sockets, so that blocking
  reads and writes are always retried by OpenSSL itself.

  locale.

- The internals of the subprocess module on POSIX systems have been replaced by
  an extension module (_posixsubprocess) so that the fork()+exec() can be done
  safely without the possibility of deadlock in multithreaded applications.

- subprocess.Popen now has restore_signals and start_new_session features.  The
  default of restore_signals=True is a new behavior compared to earlier Python
  versions.  This means that signals such as SIGPIPE are not ignored by default
  in subprocesses launched by Python (Issue #1652).

- Issue #6472: The xml.etree package is updated to ElementTree 1.3.  The
  cElementTree module is updated too.

- Issue #7774: Set sys.executable to an empty string if argv[0] has been set to
  an non existent program name and Python is unable to retrieve the real program
  name.

  bytecode file when it was less then 8 bytes.

- Issue #7633: In the decimal module, Context class methods (with the exception
  of canonical and is_canonical) now accept instances of int and long wherever a
  Decimal instance is accepted, and implicitly convert that argument to Decimal.
  Previously only some arguments were converted.

- Issue #7835: shelve should no longer produce mysterious warnings during
  interpreter shutdown.

- Issue #2746: Don't escape ampersands and angle brackets ("&", "<", ">") in XML
  processing instructions and comments.  These raw characters are allowed by the
  XML specification, and are necessary when outputting e.g.  PHP code in a
  processing instruction.  Patch by Neil Muller.

- Issue #6233: ElementTree failed converting unicode characters to XML entities
  when they could't be represented in the requested output encoding.  Patch by
  Jerry Chen.

- Issue #6003: add an argument to ``zipfile.Zipfile.writestr`` to specify the
  compression type.

- Issue #4772: Raise a ValueError when an unknown Bluetooth protocol is
  specified, rather than fall through to AF_PACKET (in the `socket` module).
  Also, raise ValueError rather than TypeError when an unknown TIPC address type
  is specified.  Patch by Brian Curtin.

- Issue #6939: Fix file I/O objects in the `io` module to keep the original file
  position when calling `truncate()`.  It would previously change the file
  position to the given argument, which goes against the tradition of
  ftruncate() and other truncation APIs.  Patch by Pascal Chambon.

- Issue #7610: Reworked implementation of the internal
  :class:`zipfile.ZipExtFile` class used to represent files stored inside an
  archive.  The new implementation is significantly faster and can be wrapped in
  a :class:`io.BufferedReader` object for more speedups.  It also solves an
  issue where interleaved calls to `read()` and `readline()` give wrong results.
  Patch by Nir Aides.

- Issue #6963: Added "maxtasksperchild" argument to multiprocessing.Pool,
  allowing for a maximum number of tasks within the pool to be completed by the

  TypeError when given an `str` object (rather than a `bytes`-like object).
  Patch by Victor Stinner and Florent Xicluna.

- Issue #7349: Make methods of file objects in the io module accept None as an
  argument where file-like objects (ie StringIO and BytesIO) accept them to mean
  the same as passing no argument.

- Issue #7357: tarfile no longer suppresses fatal extraction errors by default.

- Issue #5949: added check for correct lineends in input from IMAP server in

  access to the initgroups(3) C library call on Unix systems which implement it.
  Patch by Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #7408: Fixed distutils.tests.sdist so it doesn't check for group
  ownership when the group is not forced, because the group may be different
  from the user's group and inherit from its container when the test is run.

- Issue #4486: When an exception has an explicit cause, do not print its
  implicit context too.  This affects the `traceback` module as well as built-in

- Issue #4969: The mimetypes module now reads the MIME database from the
  registry under Windows.  Patch by Gabriel Genellina.

- Issue #6816: runpy now provides a run_path function that allows Python code to
  execute file paths that refer to source or compiled Python files as well as
  zipfiles, directories and other valid sys.path entries that contain a
  __main__.py file.  This allows applications that run other Python scripts to
  support the same flexibility as the CPython command line itself.

- Issue #7318: multiprocessing now uses a timeout when it fails to establish a
  connection with another process, rather than looping endlessly.  The default
  timeout is 20 seconds, which should be amply sufficient for local connections.

- Issue #7197: Allow unittest.TextTestRunner objects to be pickled and
  unpickled.  This fixes crashes under Windows when trying to run
  test_multiprocessing in verbose mode.

- Issue #7893: ``unittest.TextTestResult`` is made public and a ``resultclass``
  argument added to the TextTestRunner constructor allowing a different result
  class to be used without having to subclass.

- Issue #7588: ``unittest.TextTestResult.getDescription`` now includes the test
  name in failure reports even if the test has a docstring.

- Issue #3001: Add a C implementation of recursive locks which is used by
  default when instantiating a `threading.RLock` object. This makes recursive
  locks as fast as regular non-recursive locks (previously, they were slower by
  10x to 15x).

- Issue #7282: Fix a memory leak when an RLock was used in a thread other than
  those started through `threading.Thread` (for example, using
  `_thread.start_new_thread()`).

- Issue #7211: Allow 64-bit values for the `ident` and `data` fields of kevent
  objects on 64-bit systems.  Patch by Michael Broghton.

- Issue #6896: mailbox.Maildir now invalidates its internal cache each time a
  modification is done through it.  This fixes inconsistencies and test failures
  on systems with slightly bogus mtime behaviour.

- Issue #7246 & Issue #7208: getpass now properly flushes input before reading
  from stdin so that existing input does not confuse it and lead to incorrect
  entry or an IOError.  It also properly flushes it afterwards to avoid the
  terminal echoing the input afterwards on OSes such as Solaris.

- Issue #7233: Fix a number of two-argument Decimal methods to make sure that
  they accept an int or long as the second argument.  Also fix buggy handling of
  large arguments (those with coefficient longer than the current precision) in

  anachronisms in the code which were a relic of 1.5.2 compatibility.

- Issue #7082: When falling back to the MIME 'name' parameter, the correct place
  to look for it is the Content-Type header.

- Make tokenize.detect_coding() normalize utf-8 and iso-8859-1 variants like the
  builtin tokenizer.

- Issue #7048: Force Decimal.logb to round its result when that result is too
  large to fit in the current precision.

  type specifier.

- Issue #6239: ctypes.c_char_p return value must return bytes.

- Issue #6838: Use a list to accumulate the value instead of repeatedly
  concatenating strings in http.client's HTTPResponse._read_chunked providing a
  significant speed increase when downloading large files servend with a
  Transfer-Encoding of 'chunked'.

- Trying to import a submodule from a module that is not a package, ImportError
  should be raised, not AttributeError.

- When the globals past to importlib.__import__() has __package__ set to None,
  fall back to computing what __package__ should be instead of giving up.

- Raise a TypeError when the name of a module to be imported for
  importlib.__import__ is not a string (was raising an AttributeError before).

  working through proxy.  Original patch by Christopher Li, changes made by
  Senthil Kumaran.

- Add importlib.abc.ExecutionLoader to represent the PEP 302 protocol for
  loaders that allow for modules to be executed. Both importlib.abc.PyLoader and
  PyPycLoader inherit from this class and provide implementations in relation to
  other methods required by the ABCs.

- importlib.abc.PyLoader did not inherit from importlib.abc.ResourceLoader like
  the documentation said it did even though the code in PyLoader relied on the
  abstract method required by ResourceLoader.

  to handle a comparison without loss of precision.  Also add correct handling
  of infinities and nans for comparisons with float.

  making it marginally more accurate for exact powers of 2.

- Issue #9422: Fix memory leak when re-initializing a struct.Struct object.

- Issue #7900: The getgroups(2) system call on MacOSX behaves rather oddly
  compared to other unix systems. In particular, os.getgroups() does not reflect
  any changes made using os.setgroups() but basicly always returns the same
  information as the id command. os.getgroups() can now return more than 16
  groups on MacOSX.

- Issue #6095: Make directory argument to os.listdir optional.

- Issue #9277: Fix bug in struct.pack for bools in standard mode (e.g.,
  struct.pack('>?')): if conversion to bool raised an exception then that

  object in the '?' format.

- Issue #9000: datetime.timezone objects now have eval-friendly repr.

- In the math module, correctly lookup __trunc__, __ceil__, and __floor__ as
  special methods.

- Issue #9005: Prevent utctimetuple() from producing year 0 or year 10,000.
  Prior to this change, timezone adjustment in utctimetuple() could produce
  tm_year value of 0 or 10,000.  Now an OverflowError is raised in these edge
  cases.

- Issue #6641: The ``datetime.strptime`` method now supports the ``%z``
  directive.  When the ``%z`` directive is present in the format string, an
  aware ``datetime`` object is returned with ``tzinfo`` bound to a
  ``datetime.timezone`` instance constructed from the parsed offset.  If both
  ``%z`` and ``%Z`` are present, the data in ``%Z`` field is used for timezone
  name, but ``%Z`` data without ``%z`` is discarded.

- Issue #5094: The ``datetime`` module now has a simple concrete class
  implementing ``datetime.tzinfo`` interface.  Instances of the new class,
  ``datetime.timezone``, return fixed name and UTC offset from their
  ``tzname(dt)`` and ``utcoffset(dt)`` methods.  The ``dst(dt)`` method always
  returns ``None``.  A class attribute, ``utc`` contains an instance
  representing the UTC timezone.  Original patch by Rafe Kaplan.

- Issue #8973: Add __all__ to struct module; this ensures that help(struct)
  includes documentation for the struct.Struct class.

- Issue #3129: Trailing digits in struct format string are no longer ignored.
  For example, "1" or "ilib123" are now invalid formats and cause
  ``struct.error`` to be raised.  Patch by Caleb Deveraux.

- Issue #7384: If the system readline library is linked against ncurses, the
  curses module must be linked against ncurses as well. Otherwise it is not safe
  to load both the readline and curses modules in an application.

- Issue #2810: Fix cases where the Windows registry API returns ERROR_MORE_DATA,
  requiring a re-try in order to get the complete result.

- Issue #8692: Optimize math.factorial: replace the previous naive algorithm
  with an improved 'binary-split' algorithm that uses fewer multiplications and
  allows many of the multiplications to be performed using plain C integer
  arithmetic instead of PyLong arithmetic.  Also uses a lookup table for small
  arguments.

- Issue #8674: Fixed a number of incorrect or undefined-behaviour-inducing
  overflow checks in the audioop module.

- Issue #8644: The accuracy of td.total_seconds() has been improved (by
  calculating with integer arithmetic instead of float arithmetic internally):
  the result is now always correctly rounded, and is equivalent to ``td /
  timedelta(seconds=1)``.

- Issue #2706: Allow division of a timedelta by another timedelta: timedelta /
  timedelta, timedelta % timedelta, timedelta // timedelta and divmod(timedelta,
  timedelta) are all supported.

- Issue #8314: Fix unsigned long long bug in libffi on Sparc v8.

- Issue #8300: When passing a non-integer argument to struct.pack with any
  integer format code, struct.pack first attempts to convert the non-integer
  using its __index__ method.  If that method is non-existent or raises
  TypeError it goes on to try the __int__ method, as described below.

- Issue #8142: Update libffi to the 3.0.9 release.

- Issue #6949: Allow the _dbm extension to be built with db 4.8.x.

- Issue #6544: Fix a reference leak in the kqueue implementation's error
  handling.

- Stop providing crtassem.h symbols when compiling with Visual Studio 2010, as
  msvcr100.dll is not a platform assembly anymore.

- Issue #6508: Add posix.{getresuid,getresgid,setresuid,setresgid}.

- Issue #7078: Set struct.__doc__ from _struct.__doc__.

- Issue #3366: Add erf, erfc, expm1, gamma, lgamma functions to math module.

- Issue #6877: It is now possible to link the readline extension to the libedit
  readline emulation on OSX 10.5 or later.

- Issue #6848: Fix curses module build failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fix a segfault that could be triggered by expat with specially formed input.

- Issue #6561: '\d' in a regex now matches only characters with Unicode category
  'Nd' (Number, Decimal Digit).  Previously it also matched characters with
  category 'No'.

- Issue #4509: Array objects are no longer modified after an operation failing
  due to the resize restriction in-place when the object has exported buffers.

- Issue #2389: Array objects are now pickled in a portable manner.

- Expat: Fix DoS via XML document with malformed UTF-8 sequences
  (CVE_2009_3560).

- Issue #7242: On Solaris 9 and earlier calling os.fork() from within a thread
  could raise an incorrect RuntimeError about not holding the import lock.  The
  import lock is now reinitialized after fork.

- Issue #7999: os.setreuid() and os.setregid() would refuse to accept a -1
  parameter on some platforms such as OS X.

- Build the ossaudio extension on GNU/kFreeBSD.

- Issue #7347: winreg: Add CreateKeyEx and DeleteKeyEx, as well as fix a bug in
  the return value of QueryReflectionKey.

- Issue #7567: PyCurses_setupterm: Don't call ``setupterm`` twice.

Build
-----

  OPT or EXTRA_CFLAGS, although those variables are still present for
  backward-compatibility.

- Issue #8854: Fix finding Visual Studio 2008 on Windows x64.

- Issue #1759169, #8864: Drop _XOPEN_SOURCE on Solaris, define it for
  multiprocessing only.

- Issue #8625: Turn off optimization in --with-pydebug builds with gcc.
  (Optimization was unintentionally turned on in gcc --with-pydebug builds as a
  result of the issue #1628484 fix, combined with autoconf's strange choice of
  default CFLAGS produced by AC_PROG_CC for gcc.)

- Issue #3646: It is now easily possible to install a Python framework into your
  home directory on MacOSX, see Mac/README for more information.

- Issue #3928: os.mknod() now available in Solaris, also.

- Issue #3326: Build Python without -fno-strict-aliasing when the gcc does not

  tests from compileall.

- Issue #3920, #7903: Define _BSD_SOURCE on OpenBSD 4.4 through 4.9.

- Issue #7632: When Py_USING_MEMORY_DEBUGGER is defined, disable the private
  memory allocation scheme in dtoa.c and use PyMem_Malloc and PyMem_Free
  instead.  Also disable caching of powers of 5.

- Issue #6491: Allow --with-dbmliborder to specify that no dbms will be built.

- Issue #6943: Use pkg-config to find the libffi headers when the
  --with-system-ffi flag is used.

- Issue #7609: Add a --with-system-expat option that causes the system's expat
  library to be used for the pyexpat module instead of the one included with
  Python.

- Issue #7589: Only build the nis module when the correct header files are
  found.

- Switch to OpenSSL 0.9.8l and sqlite 3.6.21 on Windows.

  import lock was disabled.

- Issue #8605: Skip test_gdb if Python is compiled with optimizations.

- Issue #7449: Skip test_socketserver if threading support is disabled.

- Issue #8672: Add a zlib test ensuring that an incomplete stream can be handled
  by a decompressor object without errors (it returns incomplete uncompressed
  data).

- Issue #8533: regrtest uses backslashreplace error handler for stdout to avoid
  UnicodeEncodeError (write non-ASCII character to stdout using ASCII encoding).

- Issue #8576: Remove use of find_unused_port() in test_smtplib and
  test_multiprocessing.  Patch by Paul Moore.

- Issue #7449: Fix many tests to support Python compiled without thread
  support. Patches written by Jerry Seutter.

- Issue #8108: test_ftplib's non-blocking SSL server now has proper handling of
  SSL shutdowns.

- Issues #8279, #8330, #8437, #8480, #8495: Fix test_gdb failures, patch written
  by Dave Malcolm.

- Issue #3864: Skip three test_signal tests on freebsd6 because they fail if any
  thread was previously started, most likely due to a platform bug.

- Issue #8193: Fix test_zlib failure with zlib 1.2.4.

- Issue #8248: Add some tests for the bool type.  Patch by Gregory Nofi.

- Issue #8263: Now regrtest.py will report a failure if it receives a
  KeyboardInterrupt (SIGINT).

- Issue #8180 and #8207: Fix test_pep277 on OS X and add more tests for special
  Unicode normalization cases.

- Issue #7783: test.support.open_urlresource invalidates the outdated files from
  the local cache.

- Issue #7849: Now the utility ``check_warnings`` verifies if the warnings are
  effectively raised.

- The four path modules (genericpath, macpath, ntpath, posixpath) share a common
  TestCase for some tests: test_genericpath.CommonTest.

- Print platform information when running the whole test suite, or using the
  --verbose flag.

- Issue #767675: enable test_pep277 on POSIX platforms with Unicode-friendly
  filesystem encoding.

- Issue #6292: for the moment at least, the test suite runs cleanly if python is
  run with the -OO flag.  Tests requiring docstrings are skipped.

- Issue #7712: test.support gained a new `temp_cwd` context manager which is now
  also used by regrtest to run all the tests in a temporary directory.  The
  original CWD is saved in `support.SAVEDCWD`.  Thanks to Florent Xicluna who
  helped with the patch.

- Issue #7924: Fix an intermittent 'XXX undetected error' failure in test_capi
  (only seen so far on platforms where the curses module wasn't built), due to
  an uncleared exception.

- Issue #7728: test_timeout was changed to use support.bind_port instead of a
  hard coded port.

- Issue #7376: Instead of running a self-test (which was failing) when called
  with no arguments, doctest.py now gives a usage message.

- Issue #7396: fix regrtest -s, which was broken by the -j enhancement.

- Issue #7498: test_multiprocessing now uses test.support.find_unused_port
  instead of a hardcoded port number in test_rapid_restart.

- Issue #7431: Use TESTFN in test_linecache instead of trying to create a file
  in the Lib/test directory, which might be read-only for the user running the
  tests.

- Issue #7324: Add a sanity check to regrtest argument parsing to catch the case
  of an option with no handler.

- Issue #7312: Add a -F flag to run the selected tests in a loop until a test
  fails.  Can be combined with -j.

- Issue #6551: test_zipimport could import and then destroy some modules of the
  encodings package, which would make other tests fail further down the road
  because the internally cached encoders and decoders would point to empty
  global variables.

- Issue #7295: Do not use a hardcoded file name in test_tarfile.

- Issue #7270: Add some dedicated unit tests for multi-thread synchronization
  primitives such as Lock, RLock, Condition, Event and Semaphore.

- Issue #7248 (part 2): Use a unique temporary directory for importlib source
  tests instead of tempfile.tempdir. This prevents the tests from sharing state
  between concurrent executions on the same system.

- Issue #7248: In importlib.test.source.util a try/finally block did not make
  sure that some referenced objects actually were created in the block before
  calling methods on the object.

- Issue #7222: Make thread "reaping" more reliable so that reference
  leak-chasing test runs give sensible results. The previous method of reaping
  threads could return successfully while some Thread objects were still
  referenced. This also introduces a new private function:
  :func:`_thread._count()`.

- Issue #7151: Fixed regrtest -j so that output to stderr from a test no longer
  runs the risk of causing the worker thread to fail.

- Issue #7055: test___all__ now greedily detects all modules which have an
  __all__ attribute, rather than using a hardcoded and incomplete list.

- Issue #7058: Added save/restore for things like sys.argv and cwd to
  runtest_inner in regrtest, with warnings if the called test modifies them, and
  a new section in the summary report at the end.

- Issue #7042: Fix test_signal (test_itimer_virtual) failure on OS X 10.6.

- Fixed tests in importlib.test.source.test_abc_loader that were masking the
  proper exceptions that should be raised for missing or improper code object
  bytecode.

- Removed importlib's custom test discovery code and switched to
  unittest.TestLoader.discover().

Tools/Demos
-----------

- Issue #5464, #8974: Implement plural forms in msgfmt.py.

- iobench (a file I/O benchmark) and ccbench (a concurrency benchmark) were
  added to the `Tools/` directory.  They were previously living in the sandbox.

  the various profiling modules (profile, cProfile). Patch by Hagen Fürstenau.

Library
-------

- Issue #6438: Fixed distutils.cygwinccompiler.get_versions : the regular
  expression string pattern was trying to match against a bytes returned by
  Popen. Tested under win32 to build the py-postgresql project.

  errors property.  Additionally, the errors and encoding properties of StringIO
  are always None now.

- Issue #6137: The pickle module now translates module names when loading
  or dumping pickles with a 2.x-compatible protocol, in order to make data
  sharing and migration easier. This behaviour can be disabled using the
  new `fix_imports` optional argument.

- Removed the ipaddr module.

- Issue #3613: base64.{encode,decode}string are now called
  base64.{encode,decode}bytes which reflects what type they accept and return.

What's New in Python 3.1 release candidate 1?
=============================================

*Release date: 2009-05-30*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #6097: Escape UTF-8 surrogates resulting from mbstocs conversion
  of the command line.

- Issue #6012: Add cleanup support to O& argument parsing.

- Issue #6089: Fixed str.format with certain invalid field specifiers
  that would raise SystemError.

- Issue #5982: staticmethod and classmethod now expose the wrapped
  function with __func__.

- Added support for multiple context managers in the same with-statement.
  Deprecated contextlib.nested() which is no longer needed.

- Issue #5829: complex("1e500") no longer raises OverflowError.  This
  makes it consistent with float("1e500") and interpretation of real
  and imaginary literals.

- Issue #3527: Removed Py_WIN_WIDE_FILENAMES which is not used any more.

- Issue #5994: the marshal module now has docstrings.

- Issue #5981: Fix three minor inf/nan issues in float.fromhex:
  (1) inf and nan strings with trailing whitespace were incorrectly
  rejected;  (2) parsing of strings representing infinities and nans
  was locale aware; and (3) the interpretation of fromhex('-nan')
  didn't match that of float('-nan').

Library
-------

- Issue #4859: Implement PEP 383 for pwd, spwd, and grp.

- smtplib 'login' and 'cram-md5' login are also fixed (see Issue #5259).

- Issue #6121: pydoc now ignores leading and trailing spaces in the
  argument to the 'help' function.

- Issue #6118: urllib.parse.quote_plus ignored the encoding and errors
  arguments for strings with a space in them.

- collections.namedtuple() was not working with the following field
  names:  cls, self, tuple, itemgetter, and property.

- In unittest, using a skipping decorator on a class is now equivalent to
  skipping every test on the class.  The ClassTestSuite class has been removed.

- Issue #6050: Don't fail extracting a directory from a zipfile if
  the directory already exists.

- Issue #1309352: fcntl now converts its third arguments to a C `long` rather
  than an int, which makes some operations possible under 64-bit Linux (e.g.
  DN_MULTISHOT with F_NOTIFY).

- Issue #5761: Add the name of the underlying file to the repr() of various
  IO objects.

- Issue #5259: smtplib plain auth login no longer gives a traceback.  Fix
  by Musashi Tamura, tests by Marcin Bachry.

- Issue #1983: Fix functions taking or returning a process identifier to use
  the dedicated C type ``pid_t`` instead of a C ``int``. Some platforms have
  a process identifier type wider than the standard C integer type.

- Issue #4066: smtplib.SMTP_SSL._get_socket now correctly returns the socket.
  Patch by Farhan Ahmad, test by Marcin Bachry.

- Issue #2116: Weak references and weak dictionaries now support copy()ing and
  deepcopy()ing.

- Issue #5918: Fix a crash in the parser module.

- Issue #1664: Make nntplib IPv6-capable. Patch by Derek Morr.

- Issue #5006: Better handling of unicode byte-order marks (BOM) in the io
  library. This means, for example, that opening an UTF-16 text file in
  append mode doesn't add a BOM at the end of the file if the file isn't
  empty.

- Issue #4050: inspect.findsource/getsource now raise an IOError if the 'source'
  file is a binary.  Patch by Brodie Rao, tests by Daniel Diniz.  This fix
  corrects a pydoc regression.

- Issue #5955: aifc's close method did not close the file it wrapped,
  now it does.  This also means getfp method now returns the real fp.

Installation
------------

- Issue #6047: fullinstall has been removed because Python 3's executable will
  now be known as python3.

- Lib/smtpd.py is no longer installed as a script.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #3061: Use wcsftime for time.strftime where available.

- Issue #4873: Fix resource leaks in error cases of pwd and grp.

- Issue #6093: Fix off-by-one error in locale.strxfrm.

- The _functools and _locale modules are now built into the libpython shared
  library instead of as extension modules.

Build
-----

- Issue #3585: Add pkg-config support. It creates a python-2.7.pc file
  and a python3.pc symlink in the $(LIBDIR)/pkgconfig directory. Patch by
  Clinton Roy.

Tests
-----

- Issue #5442: Tests for importlib were not properly skipping case-sensitivity
  tests on darwin even when the OS was installed on a case-sensitive
  filesystem. Also fixed tests that should not be run when
  sys.dont_write_bytecode is true.


What's New in Python 3.1 beta 1?
================================

*Release date: 2009-05-06*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Issue #5914: Add new C API function PyOS_string_to_double, and
  deprecate PyOS_ascii_strtod and PyOS_ascii_atof.

- Issue #3382: float.__format__, complex.__format__, and %-formatting
  no longer map 'F' to 'f'. Because of issue #5859 (below), this only
  affects nan -> NAN and inf -> INF.

- Issue #5799: ntpath (ie, os.path on Windows) fully supports UNC pathnames
  in all operations, including splitdrive, split, etc.  splitunc() now issues
  a PendingDeprecation warning.

- Issue #5920: For float.__format__, change the behavior with the
  empty presentation type (that is, not one of 'e', 'f', 'g', or 'n')
  to be like 'g' but with at least one decimal point and with a
  default precision of 12. Previously, the behavior the same but with
  a default precision of 6.  This more closely matches str(), and
  reduces surprises when adding alignment flags to the empty
  presentation type. This also affects the new complex.__format__ in
  the same way.

- Implement PEP 383, Non-decodable Bytes in System Character Interfaces.

- Issue #5890: in subclasses of 'property' the __doc__ attribute was
  shadowed by classtype's, even if it was None.  property now
  inserts the __doc__ into the subclass instance __dict__.

- Issue #4426: The UTF-7 decoder was too strict and didn't accept some legal
  sequences. Patch by Nick Barnes and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #3672: Reject surrogates in utf-8 codec; add surrogatepass error handler.

- Issue #5883: In the io module, the BufferedIOBase and TextIOBase ABCs have
  received a new method, detach().  detach() disconnects the underlying stream
  from the buffer or text IO and returns it.

- Issue #5859: Remove switch from '%f' to '%g'-style formatting for
  floats with absolute value over 1e50.  Also remove length
  restrictions for float formatting: '%.67f' % 12.34 and '%.120e' %
  12.34 no longer raise an exception.

- Issue #1588: Add complex.__format__. For example,
  format(complex(1, 2./3), '.5') now produces a sensible result.

- Issue #5864: Fix empty format code formatting for floats so that it
  never gives more than the requested number of significant digits.

- Issue #5793: Rationalize isdigit / isalpha / tolower, etc. Includes
  new Py_ISDIGIT / Py_ISALPHA / Py_TOLOWER, etc. in pctypes.h.

- Issue #5835: Deprecate PyOS_ascii_formatd.

- Issue #4971: Fix titlecase for characters that are their own
  titlecase, but not their own uppercase.

- Issue #5283: Setting __class__ in __del__ caused a segfault.

- Issue #5816: complex(repr(z)) now recovers z exactly, even when
  z involves nans, infs or negative zeros.

- Issue #3166: Make int -> float conversions correctly rounded.

- Issue #1869 (and many duplicates): make round(x, n) correctly
  rounded for a float x, by using the decimal <-> binary conversions
  from Python/dtoa.c.  As a consequence, (e.g.) round(x, 2) now
  consistently agrees with format(x, '.2f').

- Issue #5787: object.__getattribute__(some_type, "__bases__") segfaulted on
  some builtin types.

- Issue #5772: format(1e100, '<') produces '1e+100', not '1.0e+100'.

- Issue #5515: str.format() type 'n' combined with commas and leading
  zeros no longer gives odd results with ints and floats.

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for
  floats.

- The str function switches to exponential notation at
  1e11, not 1e12.  This avoids printing 13 significant digits in
  situations where only 12 of them are correct.  Example problem
  value: str(1e11 + 0.5).  (This minor issue has existed in 2.x for a
  long time.)

- Issue #1580: On most platforms, use a 'short' float repr: for a
  finite float x, repr(x) now outputs a string based on the shortest
  sequence of decimal digits that rounds to x.  Previous behaviour was
  to output 17 significant digits and then strip trailing zeros.
  Another minor difference is that the new repr switches to
  exponential notation at 1e16 instead of the previous 1e17; this
  avoids misleading output in some cases.

  There's a new sys attribute sys.float_repr_style, which takes
  the value 'short' to indicate that we're using short float repr,
  and 'legacy' if the short float repr isn't available for one
  reason or another.

  The float repr change involves incorporating David Gay's 'perfect
  rounding' code into the Python core (it's in Python/dtoa.c).  As a
  secondary consequence, all string-to-float and float-to-string
  conversions (including all float formatting operations) will be
  correctly rounded on these platforms.

  See issue #1580 discussions for details of platforms for which
  this change does not apply.

- Issue #5759: float() didn't call __float__ on str subclasses.

- The string.maketrans() function is deprecated; there is a new static method
  maketrans() on the bytes and bytearray classes.  This removes confusion about
  the types string.maketrans() is supposed to work with, and mirrors the
  methods available on the str class.

- Issue #2170: refactored xml.dom.minidom.normalize, increasing both
  its clarity and its speed.

- Issue #1113244: Py_XINCREF, Py_DECREF, Py_XDECREF: Add ``do { ... } while (0)``
  to avoid compiler warnings.

- Issue #3739: The unicode-internal encoder now reports the number of characters
  consumed like any other encoder (instead of the number of bytes).

  that's valid for float() is now valid for Fraction(), with the
  exception of strings representing NaNs and infinities.

- Issue #5734: BufferedRWPair was poorly tested and had several glaring
  bugs. Patch by Brian Quinlan.

What's New in Python 3.1 alpha 2?
=================================

*Release date: 2009-4-4*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- Implement PEP 378, Format Specifier for Thousands Separator, for
  integers.

- Issue #5666: Py_BuildValue's 'c' code should create byte strings.

- Issue #5499: The 'c' code for argument parsing functions now only accepts a
  byte, and the 'C' code only accepts a unicode character.

- Fix a problem in PyErr_NormalizeException that leads to "undetected errors"
  when hitting the recursion limit under certain circumstances.

- Issue #1665206: Remove the last eager import in _warnings.c and make it lazy.

- Fix a segfault when running test_exceptions with coverage, caused by
  insufficient checks in accessors of Exception.__context__.

- Issue #5604: non-ASCII characters in module name passed to
  imp.find_module() were converted to UTF-8 while the path is
  converted to the default filesystem encoding, causing nonsense.

- Issue #5126: str.isprintable() returned False for space characters.

- Issue #4865: On MacOSX /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages is added to
  the end sys.path, for compatibility with the system install of Python.

- Issue #4688: Add a heuristic so that tuples and dicts containing only
  untrackable objects are not tracked by the garbage collector. This can
  reduce the size of collections and therefore the garbage collection overhead
  on long-running programs, depending on their particular use of datatypes.

- Issue #5512: Rewrite PyLong long division algorithm (x_divrem) to
  improve its performance.  Long divisions and remainder operations
  are now between 50% and 150% faster.

- Issue #4258: Make it possible to use base 2**30 instead of base
  2**15 for the internal representation of integers, for performance
  reasons.  Base 2**30 is enabled by default on 64-bit machines.  Add
  --enable-big-digits option to configure, which overrides the
  default.  Add sys.int_info structseq to provide information about
  the internal format.

- Issue #4474: PyUnicode_FromWideChar now converts characters outside
  the BMP to surrogate pairs, on systems with sizeof(wchar_t) == 4
  and sizeof(Py_UNICODE) == 2.

- Issue #5237: Allow auto-numbered fields in str.format(). For
  example: '{} {}'.format(1, 2) == '1 2'.

- Issue #5392: when a very low recursion limit was set, the interpreter would
  abort with a fatal error after the recursion limit was hit twice.

- Issue #3845: In PyRun_SimpleFileExFlags avoid invalid memory access with
  short file names.

Library
-------

- Issue #2625: added missing items() call to the for loop in
  mailbox.MH.get_message().

- Issue #5640: Fix _multibytecodec so that CJK codecs don't repeat
  error substitutions from non-strict codec error callbacks in
  incrementalencoder and StreamWriter.

  the -T argument.

- Issue #5647: MutableSet.__iand__() no longer mutates self during iteration.

- Issue #5624: Fix the _winreg module name still used in several modules.

- Issue #5628: Fix io.TextIOWrapper.read() with a unreadable buffer.

- Issue #5387: Fixed mmap.move crash by integer overflow.

- Issue #5261: Patch multiprocessing's semaphore.c to support context
  manager use: "with multiprocessing.Lock()" works now.

- Issue #5236: Change time.strptime() to only take strings. Didn't work with
  bytes already but the failure was non-obvious.

- Issue #5177: Multiprocessing's SocketListener class now uses
  socket.SO_REUSEADDR on all connections so that the user no longer needs
  to wait 120 seconds for the socket to expire.

- Issue #5595: Fix UnboundedLocalError in ntpath.ismount().

- Issue #1174606: Calling read() without arguments of an unbounded file
  (typically /dev/zero under Unix) could crash the interpreter.

- The max_buffer_size arguments of io.BufferedWriter, io.BufferedRWPair, and
  io.BufferedRandom have been deprecated for removal in Python 3.2.

- Issue #5068: Fixed the tarfile._BZ2Proxy.read() method that would loop
  forever on incomplete input. That caused tarfile.open() to hang when used
  with mode 'r' or 'r:bz2' and a fileobj argument that contained no data or
  partial bzip2 compressed data.

- Issue #2110: Add support for thousands separator and 'n' type
  specifier to Decimal.__format__

- Fix Decimal.__format__ bug that swapped the meanings of the '<' and
  '>' alignment characters.

- The error detection code in FileIO.close() could fail to reflect the `errno`
  value, and report it as -1 instead.

- Issue #5016: FileIO.seekable() could return False if the file position
  was negative when truncated to a C int. Patch by Victor Stinner.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #5391: mmap now deals exclusively with bytes.

- Issue #5463: In struct module, remove deprecated overflow wrapping
  when packing an integer: struct.pack('=L', -1) now raises
  struct.error instead of returning b'\xff\xff\xff\xff'.  The
  _PY_STRUCT_RANGE_CHECKING and _PY_STRUCT_OVERFLOW_MASKING constants
  have been removed from the struct module.


What's New in Python 3.1 alpha 1
================================

*Release date: 2009-03-07*

Core and Builtins
-----------------

- The io module has been reimplemented in C for speed.

- Give dict views an informative __repr__.

- Issue #5247: Improve error message when unknown format codes are
  used when using str.format() with str, int, and float arguments.

- Issue #5249: time.strftime returned malformed string when format string
  contained non ascii character on windows.

- Issue #4626: compile(), exec(), and eval() ignore the coding cookie if the
  source has already been decoded into str.

- Issue #5186: Reduce hash collisions for objects with no __hash__ method by
  rotating the object pointer by 4 bits to the right.

- Issue #4575: Fix Py_IS_INFINITY macro to work correctly on x87 FPUs:
  it now forces its argument to double before testing for infinity.

- Issue #5137: Make len() correctly raise a TypeError when a __len__ method
  returns a non-number type.

- Issue #5182: Removed memoryview.__str__.

- Issue #1717: Removed builtin cmp() function, dropped tp_compare
  slot, the C API functions PyObject_Compare and PyUnicode_Compare and
  the type definition cmpfunc.  The tp_compare slot has been renamed
  to tp_reserved, and is reserved for future usage.

- Issue #1242657: the __len__() and __length_hint__() calls in several tools
  were suppressing all exceptions.  These include list() and bytearray().

- Issue #4707: round(x, n) now returns an integer if x is an integer.
  Previously it returned a float.

- Issue #4753: By enabling a configure option named '--with-computed-gotos'
  on compilers that support it (notably: gcc, SunPro, icc), the bytecode
  evaluation loop is compiled with a new dispatch mechanism which gives
  speedups of up to 20%, depending on the system, on various benchmarks.

- Issue #4874: Most builtin decoders now reject unicode input.

- Issue #4842: Don't allow trailing 'L' when constructing an integer
  from a string.

- Issue #4991: os.fdopen now raises an OSError for invalid file descriptors.

- Issue #4838: When a module is deallocated, free the memory backing the
  optional module state data.

- Issue #4910: Rename nb_long slot to nb_reserved, and change its
  type to ``(void *)``.

- Issue #4935: The overflow checking code in the expandtabs() method common
  to str, bytes and bytearray could be optimized away by the compiler, letting
  the interpreter segfault instead of raising an error.

- Issue #3720: Fix a crash when an iterator modifies its class and removes its
  __next__ method.

- Issue #4910: Builtin int() function and PyNumber_Long/PyNumber_Int API
  function no longer attempt to call the __long__ slot to convert an object
  to an integer.  Only the __int__ and __trunc__ slots are examined.

- Issue #4893: Use NT threading on CE.

- Issue #4915: Port sysmodule to Windows CE.

- Issue #4868: utf-8, utf-16 and latin1 decoding are now 2x to 4x faster. The
  common cases are optimized thanks to a dedicated fast path and a moderate
  amount of loop unrolling.

- Issue #4074: Change the criteria for doing a full garbage collection (i.e.
  collecting the oldest generation) so that allocating lots of objects without
  destroying them does not show quadratic performance. Based on a proposal by
  Martin von Löwis at
  http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2008-June/080579.html.

- Issue #4604: Some objects of the I/O library could still be used after
  having been closed (for instance, a read() call could return some
  previously buffered data). Patch by Dmitry Vasiliev.

- Issue #4705: Fix the -u ("unbuffered binary stdout and stderr") command-line
  flag to work properly. Furthermore, when specifying -u, the text stdout
  and stderr streams have line-by-line buffering enabled (the default being
  to buffer arbitrary chunks of data).

- The internal table, _PyLong_DigitValue, is now an array of unsigned chars
  instead of ints (reducing its size from 4 to 8 times thereby reducing
  Python's overall memory).

- Issue #1180193: When importing a module from a .pyc (or .pyo) file with
  an existing .py counterpart, override the co_filename attributes of all
  code objects if the original filename is obsolete (which can happen if the
  file has been renamed, moved, or if it is accessed through different paths).
  Patch by Ziga Seilnacht and Jean-Paul Calderone.

- Issue #4580: Fix slicing of memoryviews when the item size is greater than
  one byte. Also fixes the meaning of len() so that it returns the number of
  items, rather than the size in bytes.

- Issue #4075: Use OutputDebugStringW in Py_FatalError.

- Issue #4747: When the terminal does not use utf-8, executing a script with
  non-ascii characters in its name could fail with a "SyntaxError: None" error.

- Issue #4797: IOError.filename was not set when ``_fileio.FileIO`` failed
  to open file with a bytes filename on Windows.

- Issue #3680: Reference cycles created through a dict, set or deque iterator
  did not get collected.

- Issue #4701: PyObject_Hash now implicitly calls PyType_Ready on types
  where the tp_hash and tp_dict slots are both NULL.

- Issue #4759: None is now allowed as the first argument of
  bytearray.translate().  It was always allowed for bytes.translate().

- Added test case to ensure attempts to read from a file opened for writing
  fail.

- Issue #3106: Speedup some comparisons (str/str and int/int).

- Issue #2183: Simplify and optimize bytecode for list, dict and set
  comprehensions. Original patch for list comprehensions by Neal Norwitz.

- Issue #2467: gc.DEBUG_STATS reported invalid elapsed times. Also, always
  print elapsed times, not only when some objects are uncollectable /
  unreachable. Original patch by Neil Schemenauer.

- Issue #3439: Add a bit_length method to int.

- Issue #2173: When getting device encoding, check that return value of
  nl_langinfo is not the empty string.  This was causing silent build
  failures on OS X.

- Issue #4597: Fixed several opcodes that weren't always propagating
  exceptions.

- Issue #4589: Fixed exception handling when the __exit__ function of a
  context manager returns a value that cannot be converted to a bool.

- Issue #4445: Replace "sizeof(PyBytesObject)" with
  "offsetof(PyBytesObject, ob_sval) + 1" when allocating memory for
  bytes instances.  On a typical machine this saves 3 bytes of memory
  (on average) per allocation of a bytes instance.

- Issue #4533: File read operation was dreadfully slow due to a slowly
  growing read buffer. Fixed by using the same growth rate algorithm as
  Python 2.x.

- Issue #4509: Various issues surrounding resize of bytearray objects to
  which there are buffer exports (e.g. memoryview instances).

- Issue #4233: Changed semantic of ``_fileio.FileIO``'s ``close()``
  method on file objects with closefd=False. The file descriptor is still
  kept open but the file object behaves like a closed file. The ``FileIO``
  object also got a new readonly attribute ``closefd``.

- Issue #4569: Interpreter crash when mutating a memoryview with an item size
  larger than 1.

- Issue #4748: Lambda generators no longer return a value.

- The re.sub(), re.subn() and re.split() functions now accept a flags parameter.

- Issue #5108: Handle %s like %S, %R and %A in PyUnicode_FromFormatV(): Call
  PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8() once, remember the result and output it in a second
  step. This avoids problems with counting UTF-8 bytes that ignores the effect
  of using the replace error handler in PyUnicode_DecodeUTF8().

  deadlock.

- Issue #1818: collections.namedtuple() now supports a keyword argument
  'rename' which lets invalid fieldnames be automatically converted to

  the execution of packages by looking for and executing a ``__main__``
  submodule when a package name is supplied. Initial patch by Andi

  "src.new").

- Added the ttk module. See issue #2983: Ttk support for Tkinter.

- Removed isSequenceType(), isMappingType, and isNumberType() from the
  operator module; use the abstract base classes instead.  Also removed

- Issue #5008: When a file is opened in append mode with the new IO library,
  do an explicit seek to the end of file (so that e.g. tell() returns the
  file size rather than 0). This is consistent with the behaviour of the
  traditional 2.x file object.

- Issue #5013: Fixed a bug in FileHandler which occurred when the delay
  parameter was set.

  loader). Original patch by Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issue #4201: pdb can now access and display source code loaded via
  zipimport (or any other conformant PEP 302 loader). Original patch by
  Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issue #4197: doctests in modules loaded via zipimport (or any other PEP
  302 conformant loader) will now work correctly in most cases (they
  are still subject to the constraints that exist for all code running
  from inside a module loaded via a PEP 302 loader and attempting to
  perform IO operations based on __file__). Original patch by
  Alexander Belopolsky.

- Issues #4082 and #4512: Add runpy support to zipimport in a manner that

  give correct results in the case where one argument is a quiet NaN
  and the other is a finite number that requires rounding.

Extension Modules
-----------------

- Issue #3745: Fix hashlib to always reject unicode and non buffer-api
  supporting objects as input no matter how it was compiled (built in
  implementations or external openssl library).

- Issue #4397: Fix occasional test_socket failure on OS X.

- Issue #4279: Fix build of parsermodule under Cygwin.

- Issue #4751: hashlib now releases the GIL when hashing large buffers
  (with a hardwired threshold of 2048 bytes), allowing better parallelization
  on multi-CPU systems. Contributed by Lukas Lueg (ebfe) and Victor Stinner.

- Issue #4051: Prevent conflict of UNICODE macros in cPickle.

- Issue #4738: Each zlib object now has a separate lock, allowing to compress
  or decompress several streams at once on multi-CPU systems. Also, the GIL
  is now released when computing the CRC of a large buffer. Patch by ebfe.

- Issue #4228: Pack negative values the same way as 2.4 in struct's L format.

Tests
-----

- Issue #6152: New option '-j'/'--multiprocess' for regrtest allows running
  regression tests in parallel, shortening the total runtime.

- Issue #5450: Moved tests involving loading tk from Lib/test/test_tcl to

  skip the tests if DISPLAY is defined but can't be used.

- regrtest no longer treats ImportError as equivalent to SkipTest.  Imports
  that should cause a test to be skipped are now done using import_module
  from test support, which does the conversion.

- Issue #5083: New 'gui' resource for regrtest.
