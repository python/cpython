Fix a potential memory denial of service in the :mod:`http.client` module.
When connecting to a malicious server, it could cause an arbitrary amount of
memory to be allocated. This could have led to symptoms including a
:exc:`MemoryError`, swapping, out of memory (OOM) killed processes or
containers, or even system crashes.

Fix a potential memory denial of service in the :mod:`http.server` module.
When a malicious user is connected to the CGI server on Windows, it could
cause an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated. This could have led to
symptoms including a :exc:`MemoryError`, swapping, out of memory (OOM)
killed processes or containers, or even system crashes.

Revert changes to the undocumented :class:`!re.Scanner` class. Capturing

lead to incorrect result. They will be forbidden in future Python versions.

The resource tracker in the :mod:`multiprocessing` module now uses the
original communication protocol, as in Python 3.14.0 and below, by default.
This avoids issues with upgrading Python while it is running. (Note that
such 'in-place' upgrades are not tested.) The tracker remains compatible
with subprocesses that use new protocol (that is, subprocesses using Python
3.13.10, 3.14.1 and 3.15).
