:func:`os.mkdir` on Windows now accepts *mode* of ``0o700`` to restrict the

more permissive than the default.

:func:`email.utils.getaddresses` and :func:`email.utils.parseaddr` now
return ``('', '')`` 2-tuples in more situations where invalid email
addresses are encountered instead of potentially inaccurate values. Add
optional *strict* parameter to these two functions: use ``strict=False`` to
get the old behavior, accept malformed inputs. ``getattr(email.utils,
'supports_strict_parsing', False)`` can be use to check if the *strict*
paramater is available. Patch by Thomas Dwyer and Victor Stinner to improve
the CVE-2023-27043 fix.
