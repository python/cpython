vulnerabilities including: CVE-2017-9233 (External entity infinite loop
DoS), CVE-2016-9063 (Integer overflow, re-fix), CVE-2016-0718 (Fix

Changed the implementation strategy for collections.namedtuple() to
substantially reduce the use of exec() in favor of precomputed methods. As a
result, the *verbose* parameter and *_source* attribute are no longer
supported.  The benefits include 1) having a smaller memory footprint for
applications using multiple named tuples, 2) faster creation of the named
tuple class (approx 4x to 6x depending on how it is measured), and 3) minor
speed-ups for instance creation using __new__, _make, and _replace.  (The
primary patch contributor is Jelle Zijlstra with further improvements by
INADA Naoki, Serhiy Storchaka, and Raymond Hettinger.)

There are a number of uninformative asserts in the `multiprocessing` module,
as noted in issue 5001. This change fixes two of the most potentially
problematic ones, since they are in error-reporting code, in the
`multiprocessing.managers.convert_to_error` function. (It also makes more
informative a ValueError message.) The only potentially problematic change
is that the AssertionError is now a TypeError; however, this should also
help distinguish it from an AssertionError being *reported* by the
function/its caller (such as in issue 31169). - Patch by Allen W. Smith

Convert IDLE's built-in 'extensions' to regular features.
About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional extensions.
Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for users and not good
for maintenance.  Hence the conversion.
The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings for
builtin features are now handled uniformly.  Now, editing a binding in a
keyset only affects its value in the keyset.  All bindings are defined
together in the system-specific default keysets in config-extensions.def.
All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-extension.cfg.  All take
effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.
The affected events are '<<force-open-completions>>', '<<expand-word>>',
'<<force-open-calltip>>', '<<flash-paren>>', '<<format-paragraph>>',
'<<run-module>>', '<<check-module>>', and '<<zoom-height>>'.  Any (global)
customizations made before 3.6.3 will not affect their keyset-specific
customization after 3.6.3. and vice versa.
