The trashcan mechanism is now thread-safe.  This eliminates sporadic crashes
in multi-thread programs when several long deallocator chains ran
concurrently and involved subclasses of built-in container types.

Modify `window.get_wch()` API of the curses module: return a character for
most keys, and an integer for special keys, instead of always returning an
integer. So it is now possible to distinguish special keys like keypad keys.

.. section: Library

Fix `window.addch()` of the curses module for special characters like
curses.ACS_HLINE: the Python function addch(int) and addch(bytes) is now
calling the C function waddch()/mvwaddch() (as it was done in Python 3.2),
instead of wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch(). The Python function addch(str) is still
calling the C function wadd_wch()/mvwadd_wch() if the Python curses is
linked to libncursesw.

The memoryview enhancements in 3.3.0 accidentally permitted the hashing of
multi-dimensional memorviews and memoryviews with multi-byte item formats.
The intended restrictions have now been documented - they will be correctly
enforced in 3.3.1.
