Replace help.txt with help.html for Idle doc display. The new
idlelib/help.html is rstripped Doc/build/html/library/idle.html. It looks
better than help.txt and will better document Idle as released. The tkinter
html viewer that works for this file was written by Mark Roseman. The now
unused EditorWindow.HelpDialog class and helt.txt file are deprecated.

Rewrite Comparisons section in the Expressions chapter of the language

Andy Maier.
