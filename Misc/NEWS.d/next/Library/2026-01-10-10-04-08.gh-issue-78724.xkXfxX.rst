Prevent crashes due to using half-initialized :class:`~struct.Struct`
objects. For example, created by ``Struct.__new__(Struct)``.  Calling the
``Struct.__new__()`` dunder without required argument now is deprecated.
Calling :meth:`~object.__init__` dunder method of :class:`~struct.Struct`
object on initialized object now also is deprecated.  Patch by Sergey B
Kirpichev.
