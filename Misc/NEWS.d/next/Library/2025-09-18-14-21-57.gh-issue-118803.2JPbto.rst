:class:`collections.abc.ByteString` has been removed from
``collections.abc.__all__``, and :class:`typing.ByteString` has been removed
from ``typing.__all__``. The former has been deprecated since Python 3.12,
and the latter has been deprecated since Python 3.9. Both classes are
scheduled for removal in Python 3.17.

Additionally, the following statements now cause ``DeprecationWarning``\ s to
be emitted at runtime: ``from collections.abc import ByteString``, ``from
typing import ByteString``, ``import collections.abc;
collections.abc.ByteString`` and ``import typing; typing.ByteString``. Both
classes already caused ``DeprecationWarning``\ s to be emitted if they were
subclassed or used as the second argument to ``isinstance()`` or
``issubclass()``, but they did not previously lead to
``DeprecationWarning``\ s if they were merely imported or accessed from their
respective modules.
