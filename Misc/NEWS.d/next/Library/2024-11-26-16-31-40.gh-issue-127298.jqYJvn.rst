:mod:`hashlib`'s builtin hash implementations now check ``usedforsecurity=False``,
when the OpenSSL library default provider is in OpenSSL's FIPS mode.  This helps
ensure that only US FIPS approved implementations are in use by default on systems
configured as such.

This is only active when :mod:`hashlib` has been built with OpenSSL implementation
support and said OpenSSL library includes the FIPS mode feature.  Not all variants
do, and OpenSSL is not a *required* build time dependency of ``hashlib``.
