:meth:`zoneinfo.reset_tzpath` will now convert any :class:`os.PathLike` objects
it receives into strings before adding them to ``TZPATH``. It will raise
``TypeError`` if anything other than a string is found after this conversion.
If given an :class:`os.PathLike` object that represents a relative path, it
will now raise ``ValueError`` instead of ``TypeError``, and present a more
informative error message.
