Fix bug in the parsing of email address headers that could result in
extraneous spaces in the decoded text when using a modern email policy.
Space between pairs of adjacent rfc2047 encoded-words is now ignored, per
rfc2047 section 6.2 (and consistent with existing parsing of unstructured
headers like *Subject*).
