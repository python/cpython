The classes ``ast.slice``, ``ast.Index``, ``ast.Suite``, ``ast.AugLoad``,
``ast.AugStore``, and ``ast.Param``, deprecated since Python 3.9, now issue
deprecation warnings on use. They are now scheduled for removal in Python 3.20.

The ``dims`` property of ``ast.Tuple`` objects, deprecated since Python 3.9,
now issues a deprecation warning when accessed. The property is scheduled for
removal in Python 3.20. Use the (non-deprecated) ``elts`` property of
``ast.Tuple`` objects instead.

The deprecated global names are also no longer imported by
``from ast import *``.
