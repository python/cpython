Add the optional ``buffersize`` parameter to
:meth:`multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap` and
:meth:`multiprocessing.pool.Pool.imap_unordered` to limit the number of
submitted tasks whose results have not yet been yielded. If the buffer is
full, iteration over the *iterables* pauses until a result is yielded from
the buffer. To fully utilize pool's capacity, set *buffersize* to the number
of processes in pool (to consume *iterable* as you go) or even higher (to
prefetch *buffersize - processes* arguments).
