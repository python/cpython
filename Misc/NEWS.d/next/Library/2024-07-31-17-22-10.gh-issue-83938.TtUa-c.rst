The :mod:`email` module no longer incorrectly uses :rfc:`2047` encoding for
a mailbox with non-ASCII characters in its domain. Under a policy with
:attr:`~email.policy.EmailPolicy.utf8` set ``False``, attempting to serialize
such a message will now raise an :exc:`~email.errors.InvalidMailboxError`.
Either apply an appropriate IDNA encoding to convert the domain to ASCII before
serialization, or use :data:`email.policy.SMTPUTF8` (or another policy with
``utf8=True``) to correctly pass through the internationalized domain name
as Unicode characters.
