:func:`asyncio.get_event_loop` and many other :mod:`asyncio` functions like
:func:`asyncio.ensure_future`, :func:`asyncio.shield` or
:func:`asyncio.gather`, and also the
:meth:`~asyncio.BaseDefaultEventLoopPolicy.get_event_loop` method of
:class:`asyncio.BaseDefaultEventLoopPolicy` now raise an :exc:`RuntimeError`
if called when there is no running event loop and the current event loop was
not set. Previously they implicitly created and set a new current event
loop. :exc:`DeprecationWarning` is no longer emitted if there is no running
event loop but the current event loop was set.
