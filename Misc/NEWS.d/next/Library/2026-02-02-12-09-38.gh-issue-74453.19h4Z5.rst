Deprecate :func:`os.path.commonprefix` in favor of
:func:`os.path.commonpath` for path segment prefixes.

The :func:`os.path.commonprefix` function is being deprecated due to
having a misleading name and module. The function is not safe to use for
path prefixes despite being included in a module about path manipulation,
meaning it is easy to accidentally introduce path traversal
vulnerabilities into Python programs by using this function.
