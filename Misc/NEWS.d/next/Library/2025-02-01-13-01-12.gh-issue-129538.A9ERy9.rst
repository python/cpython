This pull request addresses the issue described in `issue #129538 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/129538>`_, where the ``IPv6Interface.ip`` loses the scope ID information when accessing the IP address.

The problem occurs when an IPv6 address with a scope ID is converted into an ``IPv6Interface`` and then accessed via the ``ip`` property, resulting in the loss of the scope ID information. This behavior is unexpected and not documented.

Minimal Example Demonstrating the Issue::

   addr = ipaddress.IPv6Address("fe80::%10")
   addr_with_prefix = ipaddress.IPv6Interface((addr, 64))
   print(addr_with_prefix.ip)  # Expected: IPv6Address('fe80::%10'), Actual: IPv6Address('fe80::')

Changes Made:
1. Fix in ``IPv6Interface`` Class:
   - Updated the ``IPv6Interface`` class to ensure the scope ID is preserved when converting the IP address.
   - Modified the ``ip`` property to include the scope ID in the address string.

2. Added Test Case:
   - Added a test case to verify that the scope ID is preserved when converting the IP address in the ``IPv6Interface`` class.

Tests and Documentation:
- Updated the tests in ``Lib/test/test_ipaddress.py`` to include the new test case.
- No changes to documentation as the behavior is expected and intuitive.
