The :mod:`email` module no longer treats email addresses with non-ASCII
characters as defects when parsing a Unicode string or in the ``addr_spec``
parameter to :class:`email.headerregistry.Address`. :rfc:`5322` permits such
addresses, and they were already supported when parsing bytes and in the Address
``username`` parameter.

The (undocumented) :exc:`!email.errors.NonASCIILocalPartDefect` is no longer
used and should be considered deprecated.
