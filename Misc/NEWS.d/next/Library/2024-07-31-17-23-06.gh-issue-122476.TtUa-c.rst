The :mod:`email` module no longer incorrectly uses :rfc:`2047` encoding for
a mailbox with non-ASCII characters in its local-part. Under a policy with
:attr:`~email.policy.EmailPolicy.utf8` set ``False``, attempting to serialize
such a message will now raise an :exc:`~email.errors.InvalidMailboxError`.
There is no valid 7-bit encoding for an internationalized local-part. Use
:data:`email.policy.SMTPUTF8` (or another policy with ``utf8=True``) to
correctly pass through the local-part as Unicode characters.
