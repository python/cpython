:mod:`getopt` and :mod:`optparse` are no longer marked as deprecated.
There are legitimate reasons to use one of these modules in preference to
:mod:`argparse`, and none of these modules are at risk of being removed
from the standard library. Of the three, ``argparse`` remains the
recommended default choice, *unless* one of the concerns noted at the top of
the module documentation applies.
