The Tachyon profiler's live TUI now integrates with the experimental
:mod:`!_colorize` theming system. Users can customize colors via
:func:`!_colorize.set_theme` (experimental API, subject to change).
A :class:`!LiveProfilerLight` theme is provided for light terminal backgrounds.
Patch by Pablo Galindo.
