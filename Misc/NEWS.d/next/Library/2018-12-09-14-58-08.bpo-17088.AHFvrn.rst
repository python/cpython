ElementTree's serialization of attribute names when a default namespace is
passed was corrected. Previously, unqualified attribute names would be
rejected unnecessarily, while attributes in the default namespace would have
their prefix stripped, which goes against the rules for namespace defaulting
and uniqueness of attributes as specified in the XML namespaces spec.
