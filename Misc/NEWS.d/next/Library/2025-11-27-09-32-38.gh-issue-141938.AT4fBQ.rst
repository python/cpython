Fix :mod:`http.client` to properly reset the connection state when an
:exc:`OSError` (such as a :exc:`TimeoutError`) occurs during request sending.
Previously, the state remained inconsistent, causing subsequent
:meth:`~http.client.HTTPConnection.request` calls to raise
:exc:`~http.client.CannotSendRequest`. Patch by pareshjoshij.
