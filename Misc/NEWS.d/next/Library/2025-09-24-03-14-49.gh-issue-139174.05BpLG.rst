Add :class:`pathlib.Info` type, which queries and caches path metadata for
local filesystem paths. This type is used by the :attr:`pathlib.Path.info`
attribute, which consequently gains a :meth:`~pathlib.Info.stat` method;
this method returns an :class:`os.stat_result` object with low-level details
about the path.
