The ``profiling.sampling`` flamegraph profiler now supports inverted
flamegraph view that aggregates all leaf nodes. In a standard flamegraph, if
a hot function is called from multiple locations, it appears multiple times
as separate leaf nodes. In the inverted flamegraph, all occurrences of the
same leaf function are merged into a single aggregated node at the root,
showing the total hotness of that function in one place. The children of each
aggregated node represent its callers, making it easier to identify which
functions consume the most CPU time and where they are called from.
