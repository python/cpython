Restore the :meth:`!__ne__` method (identical to :meth:`object.__ne__`) in
:class:`collections.abc.Set` and :class:`collections.abc.Mapping` classes.
This guarantees that the ``!=`` operator is consistent with the ``==``
operator, even if the :meth:`!__ne__` method was defined in other parent
class.
