Ensure that hash functions guaranteed to be always *available* exist as
attributes of :mod:`hashlib` even if they will not work at runtime due to
missing backend implementations. For instance, ``hashlib.md5`` will no
longer raise :exc:`AttributeError` if OpenSSL is not available and Python
has been built without MD5 support. Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
