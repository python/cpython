The :mod:`_remote_debugging` module now implements frame caching in the
:class:`RemoteUnwinder` class to reduce memory reads when profiling remote
processes. When ``cache_frames=True``, unchanged portions of the call stack
are reused from previous samples, significantly improving profiling
performance for deep call stacks.
