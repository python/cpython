:mod:`hashlib`: Supporting the ``string`` keyword parameter in hash function
constructors such as :func:`~hashlib.new` or the direct hash-named constructors
such as :func:`~hashlib.md5` and :func:`~hashlib.sha256` is now deprecated and
slated for removal in Python 3.19.
Prefer passing the initial data as a positional argument for maximum backwards
compatibility.
Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
