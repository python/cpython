Attempting to mutate non-field attributes of :mod:`dataclasses`
with both *frozen* and *slots* being ``True`` now raises
:class:`~dataclasses.FrozenInstanceError` instead of :class:`TypeError`.
Their non-dataclass subclasses can now freely mutate non-field attributes,
and the original non-slotted class can be garbage collected.
