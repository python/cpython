The Unix user (:func:`pwd.getpwuid`, :func:`pwd.getpwnam`) and group
(:func:`grp.getgrgid`, :func:`grp.getgrnam`) database functions now
differentiate between a lack of record (:exc:`KeyError` is risen, the current behaviour)
and a database access error (:exc:`OSError` is risen).

Based on a patch by Oleg Iarygin.
