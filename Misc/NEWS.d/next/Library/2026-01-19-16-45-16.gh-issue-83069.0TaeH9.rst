:meth:`subprocess.Popen.wait`: when ``timeout`` is not ``None``, an efficient
event-driven mechanism now waits for process termination, if available. Linux
≥= 5.3 uses :func:`os.pidfd_open` + :func:`select.poll`. macOS and other BSD
variants use :func:`select.kqueue` + ``KQ_FILTER_PROC`` + ``KQ_NOTE_EXIT``.
Windows keeps using ``WaitForSingleObject`` (unchanged) If none of these
mechanisms are available, the function falls back to the traditional busy loop
(non-blocking call and short sleeps). Patch by Giampaolo Rodola.
