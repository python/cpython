The ``profiling.sampling`` flamegraph profiler now displays thread status
statistics showing the percentage of time threads spend holding the GIL,
running without the GIL, waiting for the GIL, and performing garbage
collection. These statistics help identify GIL contention and thread behavior
patterns. When filtering by thread, the display shows per-thread metrics.
