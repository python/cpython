:attr:`ipaddress.IPv4Address.is_private` and
:attr:`ipaddress.IPv4Network.is_private` no longer treat the
``100.64.0.0/10`` address block in a special way.

Previously the range was considered not private but not global either.

Now ``is_private`` returns ``True`` for these addresses, matching the wider
``is_private`` semantics and the IANA IPv4 Special-Purpose Address Registry
registry saying the range is not globally reachable.
