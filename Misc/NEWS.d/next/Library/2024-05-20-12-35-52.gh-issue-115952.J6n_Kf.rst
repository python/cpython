Fix a potential denial of service in the :mod:`pickle` module.
When reading a pickled data received from untrusted source, it could cause
an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated, even if the code that is
allowed to execute is restricted by overriding the
:meth:`~pickle.Unpickler.find_class` method.
In best case this could lead to a :exc:`MemoryError` or other process crash.
In worst case it could lead to swapping which would dramatically slow down the
whole system and make it less responcible.
