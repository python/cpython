Improve filtering by module in :func:`warnings.warn_explicit` if no *module*
argument is passed. It now tests the module regular expression in the
warnings filter not only against the filename with ``.py`` stripped, but
also against module names constructed starting from different parent
directories of the filename. Strip also ``.pyw`` (on Windows) and
``/__init__.py``.
