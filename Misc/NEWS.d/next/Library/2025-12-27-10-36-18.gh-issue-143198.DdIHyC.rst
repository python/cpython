:mod:`sqlite3`: fix crashes in :meth:`Connection.execute <sqlite3.Connection.execute>`
and :meth:`Connection.executemany <sqlite3.Connection.executemany>` when iterating over
the query's parameters closes the current connection. A similar issue has been fixed
for the corresponding methods on :class:`~sqlite3.Cursor` objects.
Patch by Bénédikt Tran.
