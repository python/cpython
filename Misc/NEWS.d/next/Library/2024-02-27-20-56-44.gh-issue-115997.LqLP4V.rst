Make ``http.client.HTTPResponse.read1`` and
``http.client.HTTPResponse.readline`` raise :exc:`http.client.IncompleteRead`
instead of returning zero bytes if a connection is closed before an expected
number of bytes has been read. Also, ``http.client.HTTPResponse.readline``
raises when an expected newline has not been reached. Patch by Illia Volochii.
