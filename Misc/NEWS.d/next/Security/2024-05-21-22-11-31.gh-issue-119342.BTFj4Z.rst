Fix a potential denial of service in the :mod:`plistlib` module.
When reading a Plist file received from untrusted source, it could cause
an arbitrary amount of memory to be allocated.
In best case this could lead to a :exc:`MemoryError` or other process crash.
In worst case it could lead to swapping which would dramatically slow down the
whole system and make it less responcible.
