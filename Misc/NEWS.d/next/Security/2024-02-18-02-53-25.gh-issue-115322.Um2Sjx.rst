The underlying extension modules behind :mod:`readline`:, :mod:`subprocess`,
and :mod:`ctypes` now raise audit events on previously uncovered code paths
that could lead to file system access related to C function calling and
external binary execution.  The ``ctypes.call_function`` audit hook has also
been fixed to use an unsigned value for its ``function pointer``.
