Split the tokenizer into two separate directories:
- One part includes the actual lexeme producing logic and lives in `Parser/lexer`.
- The second part wraps the lexer according to the different tokenization modes we have (string, utf-8, file, interactive, readline) and lives in `Parser/tokenizer`.
