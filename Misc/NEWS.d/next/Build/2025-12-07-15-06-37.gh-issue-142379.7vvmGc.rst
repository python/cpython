Some termio operations are not actually usable on some
architectures. For example, the TCGETA, TCSETA, TCSETAF and TCSETAW
are defined with a reference to "struct termio" on alpha, hppa and
sparc64, but "struct termio" is no longer defined since glibc 2.42,
causing a build failure.

Instead of using those operations as soon as they are defined, check
more carefully that they are actually usable. This is done using a new
m4 macro PY_CHECK_CONSTANT.
