Add a new ``./configure`` option
:option:`--enable-static-libpython-for-interpreter` which, when used
with :option:`--enable-shared`, continues to build the shared library
but does not use it for the interpreter. Instead, libpython is
statically linked into the interpreter, as if :option:`--enable-shared`
had not been used. This allows you to do a single build and get a Python
interpreter binary that does not use a shared library but also get a
shared library for use by other programs.
