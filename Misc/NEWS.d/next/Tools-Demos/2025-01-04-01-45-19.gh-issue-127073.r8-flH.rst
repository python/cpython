Previously in the REPL, when a completion list was displayed and KeyboardInterrupt
was triggered using Ctrl+C, the completion list would persist and duplicate with
each KeyboardInterrupt. Now, when KeyboardInterrupt occurs, the completion list
is properly cleared, consistent with the behavior of other errors.
