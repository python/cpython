Make CallTips selectable

Use the "ScrolledText" widget instead of "tk.Label" to display the tooltips,
and now the text in the "Calltip" window can be selected with mouse, or
scrolled by mouse wheel. Docstring is no longer need to truncated, so some
test cases have been changed. Contributed by Shixian Li.
