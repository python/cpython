Make CallTips selectable

The text display widget in the "CalltipWindow" has been changed from
"tk.Label" to "ScrolledText", and now the text in the "Calltip" window can
be selected with mouse. The display size of the "CalltipWindow" is set to
the smaller value between the size when using the "tk.Label" widget and the
default size of "tk.Text". When the displayed text exceeds the display area
of the "ScrolledText" window, showing the vertical scrollbar; otherwise,
hiding the scrollbar. Since more text can be displayed, "argspec" is no
longer truncated, and the tests related to the max lines or text truncation
have been removed from the unit tests. Contributed by Shixian Li.
