Added tests to verify that `global` and `nonlocal` statement names are only
restricted from use or assignment before their declaration, aligning with
the updated language specification and CPython's behavior. The tests also
ensure that `global` and `nonlocal` statements exhibit correct behavior.
Change by Beomsoo Kim.
