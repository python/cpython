Fix a free-threaded GC performance regression.  If there are many untracked
tuples, the GC will run too often, resulting in poor performance.  The fix
is to include untracked tuples in the "long lived" object count. The number
of frozen objects is also now included since the free-threaded GC must
scan those too.
