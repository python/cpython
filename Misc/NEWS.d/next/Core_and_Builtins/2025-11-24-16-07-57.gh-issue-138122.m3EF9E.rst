Add incomplete sample detection to prevent corrupted profiling data. The
interpreter now tracks the base frame (bottommost frame) in each thread's
``PyThreadState.base_frame``, which the profiler uses to validate that
stack unwinding reached the expected bottom. Samples that fail to unwind
completely (due to race conditions, memory corruption, or other errors)
are now rejected rather than being included as spurious single-frame stacks.
