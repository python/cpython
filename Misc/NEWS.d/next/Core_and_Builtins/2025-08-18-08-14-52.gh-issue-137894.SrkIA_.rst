Fix segmentation fault in deeply nested :func:`filter` iterator chains by
adding a ``tp_clear`` method to the filter object. Previously, creating
thousands of nested filter iterators and then consuming them would cause
a stack overflow during garbage collection, leading to interpreter crashes.
Now such cases properly raise :exc:`RecursionError` instead of crashing
the interpreter.
