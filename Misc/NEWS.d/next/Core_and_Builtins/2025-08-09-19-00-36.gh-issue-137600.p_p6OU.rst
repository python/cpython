The constructors of node types in the :mod:`ast` module now raise a
:exc:`TypeError` when a required argument is omitted or when a
keyword-argument that does not map to a field on the AST node is passed.
These cases had previously raised a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python
3.13. Patch by Brian Schubert.
