When a new tracing function is registered with
:c:func:`PyRefTracer_SetTracerC`,  replacing the current a call to the trace
function will be made with the object set to **NULL** and **event** set to
:c:data:`PyRefTracer_TRACKER_REMOVED`. This will happen just before the new
function is registered. Patch by Pablo Galindo
