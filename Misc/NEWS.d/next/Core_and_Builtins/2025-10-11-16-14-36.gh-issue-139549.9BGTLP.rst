Fix memory leak in JIT executor on compilation failure

The executor object passed to the TIER1_TO_TIER2 macro was not
decremented if the Tier 2 code returned with an exception set but
without a fatal error (i.e., not returning NULL).

This change moves the Py_DECREF call inside the TIER1_TO_TIER2
macro to ensure the executor's reference count is always decremented
after its execution, regardless of the outcome.
