Add checking if sequences ``a[alo:ahi]`` and ``b[blo:bhi]`` are the same on the
beginning of the method find_longest_match in SequenceMatcher. For identical
sequences there is no reason to run whole logic when simple check can be done.
It appears to fix issue when comparing two slightly different strings ends up
with waiting forever for the result.
