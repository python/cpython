If we are specializing to ``LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE`` or ``LOAD_ATTR_MODULE``, try
to enable deferred reference counting for the value, if the object is owned by
a different thread.  This applies to the free-threaded build only and should
improve scaling of multi-threaded programs. Note that when deferred reference
counting is enabled, the object will be deallocated by the GC, rather than by
:c:func:`Py_DECREF`.
