If we are specializing to :opcode:`LOAD_GLOBAL_MODULE` or
:opcode:`LOAD_ATTR_MODULE`, try to enable deferred reference counting for
the value, if the object is owned by a different thread.  This applies to
the free-threaded build only and will improve scaling of multi-threaded
programs. Note that when deferred reference counting is enabled, the object
will be deallocated by the GC, rather than by :c:func:`Py_DECREF`.
