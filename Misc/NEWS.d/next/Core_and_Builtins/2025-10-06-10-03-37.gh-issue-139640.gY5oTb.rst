Fix swallowing some syntax warnings in different modules if they
accidentally have the same message and are emitted from the same line.
:func:`ast.parse` no longer emits syntax warnings for
``return``/``break``/``continue`` in ``finally`` (see :pep:`765`) -- they are
only emitted during compilation.
