Fixes a regression in GC performance for a growing heap composed mostly of
small tuples.

*  Counts number of actually tracked objects, instead of trackable objects.
   This ensures that untracking tuples has the desired effect of reducing GC overhead.
*  Does not track most untrackable tuples during creation.
   This prevents large numbers of small tuples causing excessive GCs.
