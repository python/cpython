# This file lists the contents of the Limited API and Stable ABI.
# Please append new items at the end.

# The syntax of this file is not fixed.
# It is designed to be read only by Tools/build/stable_abi.py, which can change
# without notice.

# For the history of the stable ABI prior to this file,
# see the history of PC/python3dll.c and before that, PC/python3.def,
# and PC/pythonXYstub.def


# The current format is TOML.

# There are these kinds of top-level "items":
# - struct: A C struct. See `struct_abi_kind` for how much of the struct is
#   exposed.
# - function: A function that must be kept available (and exported, i.e. not
#   converted to a macro).
# - const: A simple value, defined with `#define`.
# - macro: A preprocessor macro more complex than a simple `const` value.
# - data: An exported object, which must continue to be available but its exact
#   value may change.
# - typedef: A C typedef which is used in other definitions in the limited API.
#   Its size/layout/signature must not change.
# - feature_macro: Other items may be conditional on whether this macro
#   is defined or not.

# Each top-level item can have details defined for it:
# - added: The version in which the item was added to the stable ABI.
# - ifdef: The item is only available if the given feature_macro is defined.
# - abi_only: If present, the item is not part of the Limited API, but it *is*
#   part of the stable ABI. The item will not show up in user-facing docs.
#   Typically used for:
#   - private functions called by public macros, e.g. _Py_BuildValue_SizeT
#   - items that were part of the limited API in the past, and must remain part
#     of the stable ABI.
#   - a combination of the above (functions that were called by macros that
#     were public in the past)
# - struct_abi_kind: for `struct`, defines how much of the struct is exposed:
#   - 'full-abi': All of the struct is part of the ABI, including the size
#     (users may define arrays of these structs).
#     Typically used for initialization, rather than at runtime.
#   - 'opaque': No members are part of the ABI, nor is the size. The Limited
#     API only handles these via pointers. The C definition should be
#     incomplete (opaque).
#   - 'members': Only specific members are part of the stable ABI.
#     The struct's size may change, so it can't be used in arrays.
#     Do not add new structs of this kind without an extremely good reason.
# - members: For `struct` with struct_abi_kind = 'members', a list of the
#   exposed members.
# - doc: for `feature_macro`, the blurb added in documentation
# - windows: for `feature_macro`, this macro is defined on Windows.
#   (This info is used to generate the DLL manifest and needs to be available
#   on all platforms.)

# Removing items from this file is generally not allowed, and additions should
# be considered with that in mind. See the devguide for exact rules:
