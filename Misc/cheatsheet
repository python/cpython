Invocation Options

python [-diOStuUvxX?] [-c command | script | - ] [args]

                              Invocation Options
Option                                  Effect
-c cmd  program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d      Outputs parser debugging information (also PYTHONDEBUG=x)
-E      ignore environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h      print this help message and exit
-i      Inspect interactively after running script (also PYTHONINSPECT=x) and
        force prompts, even if stdin appears not to be a terminal
-m mod  run library module as a script (terminates option list
-O      optimize generated bytecode (a tad; also PYTHONOPTIMIZE=x)
-OO     remove doc-strings in addition to the -O optimizations
-Q arg  division options: -Qold (default), -Qwarn, -Qwarnall, -Qnew
-S      Don't perform 'import site' on initialization
-t      Issue warnings about inconsistent tab usage (-tt: issue errors)
-u      Unbuffered binary stdout and stderr (also PYTHONUNBUFFERED=x).
-v      Verbose (trace import statements) (also PYTHONVERBOSE=x)
-W arg : warning control (arg is action:message:category:module:lineno)
-x      Skip first line of source, allowing use of non-unix Forms of #!cmd
-?      Help!
-3      warn about Python 3.x incompatibilities
-c      Specify the command to execute (see next section). This terminates the
command option list (following options are passed as arguments to the command).
        the name of a python file (.py) to execute read from stdin.
script  Anything afterward is passed as options to python script or command,
        not interpreted as an option to interpreter itself.
args    passed to script or command (in sys.argv[1:])
        If no script or command, Python enters interactive mode.

  * Available IDEs in std distrib: IDLE (tkinter based, portable), Pythonwin
    (Windows).



Environment variables

                             Environment variables
    Variable                                 Effect
PYTHONHOME       Alternate prefix directory (or prefix;exec_prefix). The
                 default module search path uses prefix/lib
                 Augments the default search path for module files. The format
                 is the same as the shell's $PATH: one or more directory
                 pathnames separated by ':' or ';' without spaces around
                 (semi-)colons!
PYTHONPATH       On Windows first search for Registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
                 Software\Python\PythonCore\x.y\PythonPath (default value). You
                 may also define a key named after your application with a
                 default string value giving the root directory path of your
                 app.
                 If this is the name of a readable file, the Python commands in
PYTHONSTARTUP    that file are executed before the first prompt is displayed in
                 interactive mode (no default).
PYTHONDEBUG      If non-empty, same as -d option
PYTHONINSPECT    If non-empty, same as -i option
PYTHONSUPPRESS   If non-empty, same as -s option
PYTHONUNBUFFERED If non-empty, same as -u option
PYTHONVERBOSE    If non-empty, same as -v option
PYTHONCASEOK     If non-empty, ignore case in file/module names (imports)




Notable lexical entities

Keywords

    and       del       for       is        raise
    assert    elif      from      lambda    return
    break     else      global    not       try
    class     except    if        or        while
    continue  exec      import    pass      yield
    def       finally   in        print

  * (list of keywords in std module: keyword)
  * Illegitimate Tokens (only valid in strings): @ $ ?
  * A statement must all be on a single line. To break a statement over
    multiple lines use "\", as with the C preprocessor.
    Exception: can always break when inside any (), [], or {} pair, or in
    triple-quoted strings.
  * More than one statement can appear on a line if they are separated with
    semicolons (";").
  * Comments start with "#" and continue to end of line.

Identifiers

        (letter | "_")  (letter | digit | "_")*

  * Python identifiers keywords, attributes, etc. are case-sensitive.
  * Special forms: _ident (not imported by 'from module import *'); __ident__
    (system defined name);
               __ident (class-private name mangling)

Strings

    "a string enclosed by double quotes"
    'another string delimited by single quotes and with a " inside'
    '''a string containing embedded newlines and quote (') marks, can be
    delimited with triple quotes.'''
    """ may also use 3- double quotes as delimiters """
    u'a unicode string'   U"Another unicode string"
    r'a raw string where \ are kept (literalized): handy for regular
    expressions and windows paths!'
    R"another raw string"    -- raw strings cannot end with a \
    ur'a unicode raw string'   UR"another raw unicode"

        Use \ at end of line to continue a string on next line.
        adjacent strings are concatened, e.g. 'Monty' ' Python' is the same as
        'Monty Python'.
        u'hello' + ' world'  --> u'hello world'   (coerced to unicode)

    String Literal Escapes

     \newline  Ignored (escape newline)
     \\ Backslash (\)        \e Escape (ESC)        \v Vertical Tab (VT)
     \' Single quote (')     \f Formfeed (FF)       \OOO char with octal value OOO
     \" Double quote (")     \n Linefeed (LF)
     \a Bell (BEL)           \r Carriage Return (CR) \xHH  char with hex value HH
     \b Backspace (BS)       \t Horizontal Tab (TAB)
     \uHHHH  unicode char with hex value HHHH, can only be used in unicode string
     \UHHHHHHHH  unicode char with hex value HHHHHHHH, can only be used in unicode string
     \AnyOtherChar is left as-is

  * NUL byte (\000) is NOT an end-of-string marker; NULs may be embedded in
    strings.
  * Strings (and tuples) are immutable: they cannot be modified.

Numbers

    Decimal integer: 1234, 1234567890546378940L        (or l)
    Octal integer: 0177, 0177777777777777777 (begin with a 0)
    Hex integer: 0xFF, 0XFFFFffffFFFFFFFFFF (begin with 0x or 0X)
    Long integer (unlimited precision): 1234567890123456
    Float (double precision): 3.14e-10, .001, 10., 1E3
    Complex: 1J, 2+3J, 4+5j (ends with J or j, + separates (float) real and
    imaginary parts)

Sequences

  * String of length 0, 1, 2 (see above)
    '', '1', "12", 'hello\n'
  * Tuple of length 0, 1, 2, etc:
    () (1,) (1,2)     # parentheses are optional if len > 0
  * List of length 0, 1, 2, etc:
    [] [1] [1,2]

Indexing is 0-based. Negative indices (usually) mean count backwards from end
of sequence.

Sequence slicing [starting-at-index : but-less-than-index]. Start defaults to
'0'; End defaults to 'sequence-length'.

a = (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
    a[3] ==> 3
    a[-1] ==> 7
    a[2:4] ==> (2, 3)
    a[1:] ==> (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
    a[:3] ==> (0, 1, 2)
    a[:] ==> (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7)  # makes a copy of the sequence.

Dictionaries (Mappings)

    {}                              # Zero length empty dictionary
    {1 : 'first'}                   # Dictionary with one (key, value) pair
    {1 : 'first',  'next': 'second'}
    dict([('one',1),('two',2)])     # Construct a dict from an item list
    dict('one'=1, 'two'=2)          # Construct a dict using keyword args
    dict.fromkeys(['one', 'keys'])  # Construct a dict from a sequence

Operators and their evaluation order

                     Operators and their evaluation order

        x^y                               Bitwise exclusive or
        x|y                               Bitwise or
        x<y  x<=y  x>y  x>=y  x==y x!=y   Comparison,
        x<>y                              identity,

        x or y                            boolean or
Lowest  lambda args: expr                 anonymous function

Alternate names are defined in module operator (e.g. __add__ and add for +)
Most operators are overridable.

Many binary operators also support augmented assignment:
        x += 1                            # Same as x = x + 1


Basic Types and Their Operations

Comparisons (defined between *any* types)

               Comparisons
Comparison         Meaning          Notes
<          strictly less than        (1)
<=         less than or equal to
>          strictly greater than
>=         greater than or equal to
==         equal to
!= or <>   not equal to
is         object identity           (2)
is not     negated object identity   (2)

Notes :
    Comparison behavior can be overridden for a given class by defining special
method __cmp__.
    The above comparisons return True or False which are of type bool
(a subclass of int) and behave exactly as 1 or 0 except for their type and
that they print as True or False instead of 1 or 0.
    (1) X < Y < Z < W has expected meaning, unlike C
    (2) Compare object identities (i.e. id(object)), not object values.

Boolean values and operators

                         Boolean values and operators
              Value or Operator                         Returns           Notes
None, numeric zeros, empty sequences and      False
mappings
all other values                              True
not x                                         True if x is False, else
                                              True
x or y                                        if x is False then y, else   (1)
                                              x
x and y                                       if x is False then x, else   (1)
                                              y

Notes :
    Truth testing behavior can be overridden for a given class by defining
special method __nonzero__.
    (1) Evaluate second arg only if necessary to determine outcome.

None

    None is used as default return value on functions. Built-in single object
    with type NoneType.
    Input that evaluates to None does not print when running Python
    interactively.

Numeric types

Floats, integers and long integers.

    Floats are implemented with C doubles.
    Integers are implemented with C longs.
    Long integers have unlimited size (only limit is system resources)

Operators on all numeric types

           Operators on all numeric types
 Operation                    Result
abs(x)       the absolute value of x
int(x)       x converted to integer
long(x)      x converted to long integer
float(x)     x converted to floating point
-x           x negated
+x           x unchanged
x + y        the sum of x and y
x - y        difference of x and y
x * y        product of x and y
x / y        quotient of x and y
x % y        remainder of x / y
divmod(x, y) the tuple (x/y, x%y)
x ** y       x to the power y (the same as pow(x, y))

Bit operators on integers and long integers

              Bit operators
Operation             >Result
~x        the bits of x inverted
x ^ y     bitwise exclusive or of x and y
x & y     bitwise and of x and y
x | y     bitwise or of x and y
x << n    x shifted left by n bits
x >> n    x shifted right by n bits

Complex Numbers

  * represented as a pair of machine-level double precision floating point
    numbers.
  * The real and imaginary value of a complex number z can be retrieved through
    the attributes z.real and z.imag.

Numeric exceptions

TypeError
    raised on application of arithmetic operation to non-number
OverflowError
     numeric bounds exceeded
ZeroDivisionError
     raised when zero second argument of div or modulo op
FloatingPointError
     raised when a floating point operation fails

Operations on all sequence types (lists, tuples, strings)

                Operations on all sequence types
Operation                     Result                     Notes
x in s     True if an item of s is equal to x, else False
x not in s False if an item of s is equal to x, else True
for x in s: loops over the sequence
s + t      the concatenation of s and t
s * n, n*s n copies of s concatenated
s[i]       i'th item of s, origin 0                       (1)
s[i:j]     slice of s from i (included) to j (excluded) (1), (2)
len(s)     length of s
min(s)     smallest item of s
max(s)     largest item of (s)
iter(s)    returns an iterator over s.  iterators define __iter__ and next()

Notes :
    (1) if i or j is negative, the index is relative to the end of the string,
ie len(s)+ i or len(s)+j is
         substituted. But note that -0 is still 0.
    (2) The slice of s from i to j is defined as the sequence of items with
index k such that i <= k < j.
          If i or j is greater than len(s), use len(s). If i is omitted, use
len(s). If i is greater than or
          equal to j, the slice is empty.

Operations on mutable (=modifiable) sequences (lists)

                 Operations on mutable sequences
   Operation                      Result                   Notes
s[i] =x          item i of s is replaced by x
s[i:j] = t       slice of s from i to j is replaced by t
del s[i:j]       same as s[i:j] = []
s.append(x)      same as s[len(s) : len(s)] = [x]
s.count(x)       return number of i's for which s[i] == x
s.extend(x)      same as s[len(s):len(s)]= x
s.index(x)       return smallest i such that s[i] == x      (1)
s.insert(i, x)   same as s[i:i] = [x] if i >= 0
s.pop([i])       same as x = s[i]; del s[i]; return x       (4)
s.remove(x)      same as del s[s.index(x)]                  (1)
s.reverse()      reverse the items of s in place            (3)
s.sort([cmpFct]) sort the items of s in place             (2), (3)

Notes :
    (1) raise a ValueError exception when x is not found in s (i.e. out of
range).
     (2) The sort() method takes an optional argument specifying a comparison
fct of 2 arguments (list items) which should
          return -1, 0, or 1 depending on whether the 1st argument is
considered smaller than, equal to, or larger than the 2nd
          argument. Note that this slows the sorting process down considerably.
     (3) The sort() and reverse() methods modify the list in place for economy
of space when sorting or reversing a large list.
           They don't return the sorted or reversed list to remind you of this
side effect.
     (4) [New 1.5.2] The optional  argument i defaults to -1, so that by default the last
item is removed and returned.



Operations on mappings (dictionaries)

                         Operations on mappings
        Operation                          Result                  Notes
len(d)                     the number of items in d
d[k]                       the item of d with key k                 (1)
d[k] = x                   set d[k] to x
del d[k]                   remove d[k] from d                       (1)
d.clear()                  remove all items from d
d.copy()                   a shallow copy of d
d.get(k,defaultval)        the item of d with key k                 (4)
d.has_key(k)               True if d has key k, else False
d.items()                  a copy of d's list of (key, item) pairs  (2)
d.iteritems()              an iterator over (key, value) pairs      (7)
d.iterkeys()               an iterator over the keys of d           (7)
d.itervalues()             an iterator over the values of d         (7)
d.keys()                   a copy of d's list of keys               (2)
d1.update(d2)              for k, v in d2.items(): d1[k] = v        (3)
d.values()                 a copy of d's list of values             (2)
d.pop(k)                   remove d[k] and return its value
d.popitem()                remove and return an arbitrary           (6)
                           (key, item) pair
d.setdefault(k,defaultval) the item of d with key k                 (5)

    Notes :
      TypeError is raised if key is not acceptable
      (1) KeyError is raised if key k is not in the map
      (2) Keys and values are listed in random order
      (3) d2 must be of the same type as d1
      (4) Never raises an exception if k is not in the map, instead it returns
    defaultVal.
          defaultVal is optional, when not provided and k is not in the map,
    None is returned.
      (5) Never raises an exception if k is not in the map, instead it returns
    defaultVal, and adds k to map with value defaultVal. defaultVal is
    optional. When not provided and k is not in the map, None is returned and
    added to map.
      (6) Raises a KeyError if the dictionary is emtpy.
      (7) While iterating over a dictionary, the values may be updated but

Operations on strings

Note that these string methods largely (but not completely) supersede the
functions available in the string module.

Notes :
    (1) Padding is done using spaces.
    (2) If optional argument start is supplied, substring s[start:] is
processed. If optional arguments start and end are supplied, substring s[start:
end] is processed.
    (3) Optional argument errors may be given to set a different error handling
scheme. The default for errors is 'strict', meaning that encoding errors raise
a ValueError. Other possible values are 'ignore' and 'replace'.
    (4) If optional argument tabsize is not given, a tab size of 8 characters
is assumed.
    (5) Returns false if string s does not contain at least one character.
    (6) Returns false if string s does not contain at least one cased
character.
    (7) A titlecased string is a string in which uppercase characters may only
follow uncased characters and lowercase characters only cased ones.
    (8) s is returned if width is less than len(s).
    (9) If the optional argument maxsplit is given, only the first maxsplit
occurrences are replaced.
    (10) If sep is not specified or None, any whitespace string is a separator.
If maxsplit is given, at most maxsplit splits are done.
    (11) Line breaks are not included in the resulting list unless keepends is
given and true.
    (12) table must be a string of length 256. All characters occurring in the
optional argument deletechars are removed prior to translation.

String formatting with the % operator

formatString % args--> evaluates to a string

  * formatString uses C printf format codes : %, c, s, i, d, u, o, x, X, e, E,
    f, g, G, r (details below).
  * Width and precision may be a * to specify that an integer argument gives
    the actual width or precision.
  * The flag characters -, +, blank, # and 0 are understood. (details below)
  * %s will convert any type argument to string (uses str() function)
  * args may be a single arg or a tuple of args

        '%s has %03d quote types.' % ('Python', 2)  # => 'Python has 002 quote types.'

  * Right-hand-side can also be a mapping:

        a = '%(lang)s has %(c)03d quote types.' % {'c':2, 'lang':'Python}
(vars() function very handy to use on right-hand-side.)

                                 Format codes
Conversion                               Meaning
d          Signed integer decimal.
i          Signed integer decimal.
o          Unsigned octal.
u          Unsigned decimal.
x          Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase).
X          Unsigned hexadecimal (uppercase).
e          Floating point exponential format (lowercase).
E          Floating point exponential format (uppercase).
f          Floating point decimal format.
F          Floating point decimal format.
g          Same as "e" if exponent is greater than -4 or less than precision,
           "f" otherwise.
G          Same as "E" if exponent is greater than -4 or less than precision,
           "F" otherwise.
c          Single character (accepts integer or single character string).
r          String (converts any python object using repr()).
s          String (converts any python object using str()).
%          No argument is converted, results in a "%" character in the result.
           (The complete specification is %%.)

                          Conversion flag characters
Flag                                  Meaning
#    The value conversion will use the ``alternate form''.
0    The conversion will be zero padded.
-    The converted value is left adjusted (overrides "-").
     (a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty
     string) produced by a signed conversion.
+    A sign character ("+" or "-") will precede the conversion (overrides a
     "space" flag).

File Objects

Created with built-in function open; may be created by other modules' functions
as well.

Operators on file objects

                                File operations
    Operation                                Result
f.close()         Close file f.
f.fileno()        Get fileno (fd) for file f.
f.flush()         Flush file f's internal buffer.
f.isatty()        True if file f is connected to a tty-like dev, else False.
f.read([size])    Read at most size bytes from file f and return as a string
                  object. If size omitted, read to EOF.
f.readline()      Read one entire line from file f.
f.readlines()     Read until EOF with readline() and return list of lines read.
                  Set file f's position, like "stdio's fseek()".
f.seek(offset[,   whence == 0 then use absolute indexing.
whence=0])        whence == 1 then offset relative to current pos.
                  whence == 2 then offset relative to file end.
f.tell()          Return file f's current position (byte offset).
f.write(str)      Write string to file f.
f.writelines(list Write list of strings to file f.
)

File Exceptions

  EOFError
     End-of-file hit when reading (may be raised many times, e.g. if f is a
    tty).
  IOError
     Other I/O-related I/O operation failure.
  OSError
     OS system call failed.


    Advanced Types

    -See manuals for more details -
      + Module objects
      + Class objects
      + Class instance objects
      + Type objects (see module: types)
      + File objects (see above)
      + Slice objects
      + XRange objects
      + Callable types:
          o User-defined (written in Python):
              # User-defined Function objects
              # User-defined Method objects
          o Built-in (written in C):
              # Built-in Function objects
              # Built-in Method objects
      + Internal Types:
          o Code objects (byte-compile executable Python code: bytecode)
          o Frame objects (execution frames)
          o Traceback objects (stack trace of an exception)


    Statements

    pass            -- Null statement
    del name[,name]* -- Unbind name(s) from object. Object will be indirectly
                        (and automatically) deleted only if no longer referenced.
    print [>> fileobject,] [s1 [, s2 ]* [,]
                    -- Writes to sys.stdout, or to fileobject if supplied.
                       Puts spaces between arguments. Puts newline at end
                       unless statement ends with comma.
                       Print is not required when running interactively,
                       simply typing an expression will print its value,
                       unless the value is None.
    exec x [in globals [,locals]]
                    -- Executes x in namespaces provided. Defaults
                       to current namespaces. x can be a string, file
                       object or a function object.
    callable(value,... [id=value], [*args], [**kw])
                    -- Call function callable with parameters. Parameters can
                       be passed by name or be omitted if function
                       defines default values. E.g. if callable is defined as
                       "def callable(p1=1, p2=2)"
                       "callable()"       <=>  "callable(1, 2)"
                       "callable(10)"     <=>  "callable(10, 2)"
                       "callable(p2=99)"  <=>  "callable(1, 99)"
                       *args is a tuple of positional arguments.
                       **kw is a dictionary of keyword arguments.

    Assignment operators

                              Caption
    Operator                    Result                     Notes
    a = b    Basic assignment - assign object b to label a  (1)
    a += b   Roughly equivalent to a = a + b                (2)
    a -= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a - b                (2)
    a *= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a * b                (2)
    a /= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a / b                (2)
    a %= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a % b                (2)
    a **= b  Roughly equivalent to a = a ** b               (2)
    a &= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a & b                (2)
    a |= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a | b                (2)
    a ^= b   Roughly equivalent to a = a ^ b                (2)
    a >>= b  Roughly equivalent to a = a >> b               (2)
    a <<= b  Roughly equivalent to a = a << b               (2)

    Notes :
        (1) Can unpack tuples, lists, and strings.
           first, second = a[0:2]; [f, s] = range(2); c1,c2,c3='abc'
           Tip: x,y = y,x swaps x and y.
        (2) Not exactly equivalent - a is evaluated only once. Also, where
    possible, operation performed in-place - a is modified rather than
    replaced.

    Control Flow

    if condition: suite
    [elif condition: suite]*
    [else: suite]   -- usual if/else_if/else statement
    while condition: suite
    [else: suite]
                    -- usual while statement. "else" suite is executed
                       after loop exits, unless the loop is exited with
                       "break"
    for element in sequence: suite
    [else: suite]
                    -- iterates over sequence, assigning each element to element.
                       Use built-in range function to iterate a number of times.
                       "else" suite executed at end unless loop exited
                       with "break"
    break           -- immediately exits "for" or "while" loop
    continue        -- immediately does next iteration of "for" or "while" loop
    return [result] -- Exits from function (or method) and returns result (use a tuple to
                       return more than one value). If no result given, then returns None.
    yield result    -- Freezes the execution frame of a generator and returns the result
                       to the iterator's .next() method.  Upon the next call to next(),
                       resumes execution at the frozen point with all of the local variables
                       still intact.

    Exception Statements

    assert expr[, message]
                    -- expr is evaluated. if false, raises exception AssertionError
                       with message. Inhibited if __debug__ is 0.
    try: suite1
    [except [exception [, value]: suite2]+
    [else: suite3]
                    -- statements in suite1 are executed. If an exception occurs, look
                       in "except" clauses for matching <exception>. If matches or bare
                       "except" execute suite of that clause. If no exception happens
                       suite in "else" clause is executed after suite1.
                       If exception has a value, it is put in value.
                       exception can also be tuple of exceptions, e.g.
                       "except (KeyError, NameError), val: print val"
    try: suite1
    finally: suite2
                    -- statements in suite1 are executed. If no
                       exception, execute suite2 (even if suite1 is
                       exited with a "return", "break" or "continue"
                       statement). If exception did occur, executes
                       suite2 and then immediately reraises exception.
    raise exception [,value [, traceback]]
                    -- raises exception with optional value
                       value. Arg traceback specifies a traceback object to
                       use when printing the exception's backtrace.
    raise           -- a raise statement without arguments re-raises
                       the last exception raised in the current function
An exception is either a string (object) or a class instance.
  Can create a new one simply by creating a new string:

              my_exception = 'You did something wrong'
      try:
                   if bad:
              raise my_exception, bad
      except my_exception, value:
                    print 'Oops', value

Exception classes must be derived from the predefined class: Exception, e.g.:
            class text_exception(Exception): pass
            try:
                if bad:
                    raise text_exception()
                    # This is a shorthand for the form
                    # "raise <class>, <instance>"
             except Exception:
                 print 'Oops'
                 # This will be printed because
                 # text_exception is a subclass of Exception
When an error message is printed for an unhandled exception which is a
class, the class name is printed, then a colon and a space, and
finally the instance converted to a string using the built-in function
str().
All built-in exception classes derives from StandardError, itself
derived from Exception.

Name Space Statements

[1.51: On Mac & Windows, the case of module file names must now match the case
as used
  in the import statement]
Packages (>1.5): a package is a name space which maps to a directory including
                module(s) and the special initialization module '__init__.py'
                (possibly empty). Packages/dirs can be nested. You address a
                module's symbol via '[package.[package...]module.symbol's.
import module1 [as name1] [, module2]*
                -- imports modules. Members of module must be
                   referred to by qualifying with [package.]module name:

                   "import package1.subpackage.module; package1.subpackage.module.foo()"

                   "from package.module import *; print x'
                    NB: "from package import *" only imports the symbols defined
                    in the package's __init__.py file, not those in the
                    template modules!
global name1 [, name2]*

                       -Try to read from "a", gets value from module
                       -Try to write to "a", creates "a" local to fct
                   But note "a[0]=3" starts with search for "a",
                   will use to global "a" if no local "a".

Function Definition

def func_id ([param_list]): suite
                -- Creates a function object & binds it to name func_id.

    param_list ::= [id [, id]*]
    id ::= value | id = value | *id | **id
    [Args are passed by value.Thus only args representing a mutable object
    can be modified (are inout parameters). Use a tuple to return more than
    one value]

Example:
        def test (p1, p2 = 1+1, *rest, **keywords):
            -- Parameters with "=" have default value (v is
               evaluated when function defined).
               If list has "*id" then id is assigned a tuple of
               all remaining args passed to function (like C vararg)
               If list has "**id" then id is assigned a dictionary of
               all extra arguments passed as keywords.

Class Definition

class <class_id> [(<super_class1> [,<super_class2>]*)]: <suite>
        -- Creates a class object and assigns it name <class_id>
           <suite> may contain local "defs" of class methods and
           assignments to class attributes.
Example:
       class my_class (class1, class_list[3]): ...
                  Creates a class object inheriting from both "class1" and whatever
                  class object "class_list[3]" evaluates to. Assigns new
                  class object to name "my_class".
        - First arg to class methods is always instance object, called 'self'
          by convention.
        - Special method __init__() is called when instance is created.
        - Special method __del__() called when no more reference to object.
        - Create instance by "calling" class object, possibly with arg
          (thus instance=apply(aClassObject, args...) creates an instance!)
        - In current implementation, can't subclass off built-in
          classes. But can "wrap" them, see UserDict & UserList modules,
          and see __getattr__() below.
Example:
        class c (c_parent):
           def __init__(self, name): self.name = name
           def print_name(self): print "I'm", self.name
           def call_parent(self): c_parent.print_name(self)
           instance = c('tom')
           print instance.name
           'tom'
           instance.print_name()
           "I'm tom"
        Call parent's super class by accessing parent's method
        directly and passing "self" explicitly (see "call_parent"
        in example above).
        Many other special methods available for implementing
        arithmetic operators, sequence, mapping indexing, etc.

Documentation Strings

Modules, classes and functions may be documented by placing a string literal by
itself as the first statement in the suite. The documentation can be retrieved
by getting the '__doc__' attribute from the module, class or function.
Example:
        class C:
            "A description of C"
            def __init__(self):
                "A description of the constructor"
                # etc.
Then c.__doc__ == "A description of C".
Then c.__init__.__doc__ == "A description of the constructor".

Others

lambda [param_list]: returnedExpr
                -- Creates an anonymous function. returnedExpr must be
                   an expression, not a statement (e.g., not "if xx:...",
                   "print xxx", etc.) and thus can't contain newlines.
                   Used mostly for filter(), map(), reduce() functions, and GUI callbacks..
List comprehensions
result = [expression for item1 in sequence1  [if condition1]
                        [for item2 in sequence2 ... for itemN in sequenceN]
                      ]
is equivalent to:
result = []
for item1 in sequence1:
    for item2 in sequence2:
    ...
        for itemN in sequenceN:
             if (condition1) and furthur conditions:
                  result.append(expression)

Standard methods & operators redefinition in classes

Standard methods & operators map to special '__methods__' and thus may be
 redefined (mostly in in user-defined classes), e.g.:
    class x:
         def __init__(self, v): self.value = v
         def __add__(self, r): return self.value + r
    a = x(3) # sort of like calling x.__init__(a, 3)
    a + 4    # is equivalent to a.__add__(4)

Special methods for any class

(s: self, o: other)
        __init__(s, args) instance initialization (on construction)
        __del__(s)        called on object demise (refcount becomes 0)
        __repr__(s)       repr() and `...` conversions
        __str__(s)        str() and 'print' statement
        __cmp__(s, o)     Compares s to o and returns <0, 0, or >0.
                          Implements >, <, == etc...
        __hash__(s)       Compute a 32 bit hash code; hash() and dictionary ops
        __nonzero__(s)    Returns False or True for truth value testing
        __getattr__(s, name)  called when attr lookup doesn't find <name>
        __setattr__(s, name, val) called when setting an attr
                                  (inside, don't use "self.name = value"
                                   use "self.__dict__[name] = val")
        __delattr__(s, name)  called to delete attr <name>
        __call__(self, *args) called when an instance is called as function.

    2 variants, with or without
    ading & trailing '__' (eg. __add__ or add).

                                   re (sre)

Handles Unicode strings. Implemented in new module sre, re now a mere front-end
for compatibility.
Patterns are specified as strings. Tip: Use raw strings (e.g. r'\w*') to
litteralize backslashes.


                           Regular expression syntax
   Form                                Description
.          matches any character (including newline if DOTALL flag specified)
^          matches start of the string (of every line in MULTILINE mode)
$          matches end of the string (of every line in MULTILINE mode)
*          0 or more of preceding regular expression (as many as possible)
+          1 or more of preceding regular expression (as many as possible)
?          0 or 1 occurrence of preceding regular expression
*?, +?, ?? Same as *, + and ? but matches as few characters as possible
{m,n}      matches from m to n repetitions of preceding RE
{m,n}?     idem, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible
[ ]        defines character set: e.g. '[a-zA-Z]' to match all letters(see also
           \w \S)
[^ ]       defines complemented character set: matches if char is NOT in set
           escapes special chars '*?+&$|()' and introduces special sequences
\          (see below). Due to Python string rules, write as '\\' orr'\' in the
           pattern string.
\\         matches a litteral '\'; due to Python string rules, write as '\\\\
           'in pattern string, or better using raw string: r'\\'.
|          specifies alternative: 'foo|bar' matches 'foo' or 'bar'
(...)      matches any RE inside (), and delimits a group.
(?:...)    idem but doesn't delimit a group.
           matches if ... matches next, but doesn't consume any of the string
(?=...)    e.g. 'Isaac (?=Asimov)' matches 'Isaac' only if followed by
           'Asimov'.
(?!...)    matches if ... doesn't match next. Negative of (?=...)
(?P<name   matches any RE inside (), and delimits a named group. (e.g. r'(?P
>...)      <id>[a-zA-Z_]\w*)' defines a group named id)
(?P=name)  matches whatever text was matched by the earlier group named name.
(?#...)    A comment; ignored.
(?letter)  letter is one of 'i','L', 'm', 's', 'x'. Set the corresponding flags
           (re.I, re.L, re.M, re.S, re.X) for the entire RE.

                               Special sequences
Sequence                              Description
number   matches content of the group of the same number; groups are numbered
         starting from 1
\A       matches only at the start of the string
\b       empty str at beg or end of word: '\bis\b' matches 'is', but not 'his'
\B       empty str NOT at beginning or end of word
\d       any decimal digit (<=> [0-9])
\D       any non-decimal digit char (<=> [^O-9])
\s       any whitespace char (<=> [ \t\n\r\f\v])
\S       any non-whitespace char (<=> [^ \t\n\r\f\v])
\w       any alphaNumeric char (depends on LOCALE flag)
\W       any non-alphaNumeric char (depends on LOCALE flag)
\Z       matches only at the end of the string

Regular Expression Objects


(RE objects are returned by the compile fct)

                          re object attributes
Attribute                            Descrition
flags      flags arg used when RE obj was compiled, or 0 if none provided
groupindex dictionary of {group name: group number} in pattern
pattern    pattern string from which RE obj was compiled

                               re object methods
  Method                                  Result
            If zero or more characters at the beginning of string match this
            regular expression, return a corresponding MatchObject instance.
            Return None if the string does not match the pattern; note that
            this is different from a zero-length match.
            The optional second parameter pos gives an index in the string
match(      where the search is to start; it defaults to 0. This is not
string[,    completely equivalent to slicing the string; the '' pattern
pos][,      character matches at the real beginning of the string and at
endpos])    positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the index
            where the search is to start.
            The optional parameter endpos limits how far the string will be
            searched; it will be as if the string is endpos characters long, so
            only the characters from pos to endpos will be searched for a
            match.
            Scan through string looking for a location where this regular
search(     expression produces a match, and return a corresponding MatchObject
string[,    instance. Return None if no position in the string matches the
pos][,      pattern; note that this is different from finding a zero-length
endpos])    match at some point in the string.
            The optional pos and endpos parameters have the same meaning as for
            the match() method.

          which RE engine started search.
endpos    value of endpos passed to search or match functions; index intostring
          beyond which RE engine won't go.

group([g1 string;if multiple args, result is a tuple with one item per arg. If
, g2,     gi is 0,return value is entire matching string; if 1 <= gi <= 99,
...])     returnstring matching group #gi (or None if no such group); gi may
          also bea group name.
          returns a tuple of all groups of the match; groups not
groups()  participatingto the match have a value of None. Returns a string
          instead of tupleif len(tuple)=1
start(
group),   returns indices of start & end of substring matched by group (or
end(group Noneif group exists but doesn't contribute to the match)
)
span(     returns the 2-tuple (start(group), end(group)); can be (None, None)if
group)    group didn't contibute to the match.

Python Mode for Emacs

(Not revised, possibly not up to date)
Type C-c ? when in python-mode for extensive help.
INDENTATION
Primarily for entering new code:
        TAB      indent line appropriately
        LFD      insert newline, then indent
        DEL      reduce indentation, or delete single character
Primarily for reindenting existing code:
        C-c :    guess py-indent-offset from file content; change locally
        C-u C-c :        ditto, but change globally
        C-c TAB  reindent region to match its context
        C-c <    shift region left by py-indent-offset
        C-c >    shift region right by py-indent-offset
MARKING & MANIPULATING REGIONS OF CODE
C-c C-b         mark block of lines
M-C-h           mark smallest enclosing def
C-u M-C-h       mark smallest enclosing class
C-c #           comment out region of code
C-u C-c #       uncomment region of code
MOVING POINT
C-c C-p         move to statement preceding point
C-c C-n         move to statement following point
C-c C-u         move up to start of current block
M-C-a           move to start of def
C-u M-C-a       move to start of class
M-C-e           move to end of def
C-u M-C-e       move to end of class
EXECUTING PYTHON CODE
C-c C-c sends the entire buffer to the Python interpreter
C-c |   sends the current region
C-c !   starts a Python interpreter window; this will be used by
        subsequent C-c C-c or C-c | commands
C-c C-w runs PyChecker

VARIABLES
py-indent-offset        indentation increment
py-block-comment-prefix comment string used by py-comment-region
py-python-command       shell command to invoke Python interpreter
py-scroll-process-buffer        t means always scroll Python process buffer
py-temp-directory       directory used for temp files (if needed)
py-beep-if-tab-change   ring the bell if tab-width is changed


The Python Debugger

(Not revised, possibly not up to date, see 1.5.2 Library Ref section 9.1; in 1.5.2, you may also use debugger integrated in IDLE)

Accessing

import pdb      (it's a module written in Python)
        -- defines functions :
           run(statement[,globals[, locals]])
                        -- execute statement string under debugger control, with optional
                           global & local environment.
           runeval(expression[,globals[, locals]])
                        -- same as run, but evaluate expression and return value.
           runcall(function[, argument, ...])
                        -- run function object with given arg(s)
           pm()         -- run postmortem on last exception (like debugging a core file)
           post_mortem(t)
                        -- run postmortem on traceback object <t>

        -- defines class Pdb :
           use Pdb to create reusable debugger objects. Object
           preserves state (i.e. break points) between calls.

        runs until a breakpoint hit, exception, or end of program
        If exception, variable '__exception__' holds (exception,value).

Commands

h, help
        brief reminder of commands
b, break [<arg>]
        if <arg> numeric, break at line <arg> in current file
        if <arg> is function object, break on entry to fcn <arg>
        if no arg, list breakpoints
cl, clear [<arg>]
        if <arg> numeric, clear breakpoint at <arg> in current file
        if no arg, clear all breakpoints after confirmation
w, where
        print current call stack
u, up
        move up one stack frame (to top-level caller)
d, down
        move down one stack frame
s, step
        advance one line in the program, stepping into calls
n, next
        advance one line, stepping over calls
r, return
        continue execution until current function returns
        (return value is saved in variable "__return__", which
        can be printed or manipulated from debugger)
c, continue
        continue until next breakpoint
j, jump lineno
        Set the next line that will be executed
a, args
        print args to current function
rv, retval
        prints return value from last function that returned
p, print <arg>
        prints value of <arg> in current stack frame
l, list [<first> [, <last>]]
               List source code for the current file.
               Without arguments, list 11 lines around the current line
               or continue the previous listing.
               With one argument, list 11 lines starting at that line.
               With two arguments, list the given range;
               if the second argument is less than the first, it is a count.
whatis <arg>
        prints type of <arg>
!
        executes rest of line as a Python statement in the current stack frame
q quit
        immediately stop execution and leave debugger
<return>
        executes last command again
Any input debugger doesn't recognize as a command is assumed to be a
Python statement to execute in the current stack frame, the same way
the exclamation mark ("!") command does.

Quirks

Breakpoints are stored as filename, line number tuples. If a module is reloaded
after editing, any remembered breakpoints are likely to be wrong.

Always single-steps through top-most stack frame. That is, "c" acts like "n".
