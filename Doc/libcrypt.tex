This module implements an interface to the crypt(\strong{3}) routine,
which is a one-way hash function based upon a modified DES algorithm;
see the \UNIX{} man page for further details.  Possible uses include
allowing Python scripts to accept typed passwords from the user, or
attempting to crack \UNIX{} passwords with a dictionary.

\begin{funcdesc}{crypt}{word\, salt} 
\var{word} will usually be a user's password.  \var{salt} is a
2-character string which will be used to select one of 4096 variations
of DES.  The characters in \var{salt} must be either \code{.},
\code{/}, or an alphanumeric character.  Returns the hashed password
as a string, which will be composed of characters from the same
alphabet as the salt.

The module and documentation were written by Steve Majewski.
