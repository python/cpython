This file describes the built-in types, exceptions and functions and the
standard modules that come with the Python system.  It assumes basic
knowledge about the Python language.  For an informal introduction to
the language, see the Python Tutorial.  The Python Reference Manual
gives a more formal definition of the language.  (These manuals are not
yet available in INFO or Texinfo format.)

This file describes the built-in types, exceptions and functions and the
standard modules that come with the Python system.  It assumes basic
knowledge about the Python language.  For an informal introduction to
the language, see the @cite{Python Tutorial}.  The @cite{Python
Reference Manual} gives a more formal definition of the language.
(These manuals are not yet available in INFO or Texinfo format.)

This version corresponds roughly to Python version 1.0 (yet to be released).
