Pending removal in Python 3.17
------------------------------

* :mod:`typing`:

  - Before Python 3.14, old-style unions were implemented using the private class
    ``typing._UnionGenericAlias``. This class is no longer needed for the implementation,
    but it has been retained for backward compatibility, with removal scheduled for Python
    3.17. Users should use documented introspection helpers like :func:`typing.get_origin`
    and :func:`typing.get_args` instead of relying on private implementation details.
  - :class:`typing.ByteString`, deprecated since Python 3.9, is scheduled for removal in
    Python 3.17. Prefer :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence` or
    :class:`~collections.abc.Buffer`. For use in type annotations, prefer a union, like
    ``bytes | bytearray``, or :class:`collections.abc.Buffer`.
