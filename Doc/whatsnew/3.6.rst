****************************
  What's New In Python 3.6
****************************

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the bug/patch number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :issue:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the Mercurial log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.6, compared to 3.5.

For full details, see the :source:`Misc/NEWS` file.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.6 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

.. This section singles out the most important changes in Python 3.6.
   Brevity is key.

* None yet.

.. PEP-sized items next.

.. _pep-4XX:

.. PEP 4XX: Virtual Environments
.. =============================


.. (Implemented by Foo Bar.)

.. .. seealso::

    :pep:`4XX` - Python Virtual Environments
       PEP written by Carl Meyer


Other Language Changes
======================

* None yet.


New Modules
===========

* None yet.


Improved Modules
================

datetime
--------

:meth:`datetime.stftime <datetime.datetime.stftime>` and
:meth:`date.stftime <datetime.date.stftime>` methods now support ISO 8601 date
directives ``%G``, ``%u`` and ``%V``.
(Contributed by Ashley Anderson in :issue:`12006`.)


operator
--------

New object :data:`operator.subscript` makes it easier to create complex
indexers. For example: ``subscript[0:10:2] == slice(0, 10, 2)``
(Contributed by Joe Jevnik in :issue:`24379`.)


rlcomplete
----------

Private and special attribute names now are omitted unless the prefix starts
with underscores.  A space or a colon can be added after completed keyword.
(Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :issue:`25011` and :issue:`25209`.)


urllib.robotparser
------------------

:class:`~urllib.robotparser.RobotFileParser` now supports ``Crawl-delay`` and
``Request-rate`` extensions.
(Contributed by Nikolay Bogoychev in :issue:`16099`.)


Optimizations
=============

* The ASCII decoder is now up to 60 times as fast for error handlers:
  ``surrogateescape``, ``ignore`` and ``replace``.

* The ASCII and the Latin1 encoders are now up to 3 times as fast for the error
  error ``surrogateescape``.

* The UTF-8 encoder is now up to 75 times as fast for error handlers:
  ``ignore``, ``replace``, ``surrogateescape``, ``surrogatepass``.

* The UTF-8 decoder is now up to 15 times as fast for error handlers:
  ``ignore``, ``replace`` and ``surrogateescape``.


Build and C API Changes
=======================

* None yet.


Deprecated
==========

New Keywords
------------

``async`` and ``await`` are not recommended to be used as variable, class,
function or module names.  Introduced by :pep:`492` in Python 3.5, they will
become proper keywords in Python 3.7.


Deprecated Python modules, functions and methods
------------------------------------------------

* None yet.


Deprecated functions and types of the C API
-------------------------------------------

* None yet.


Deprecated features
-------------------

* None yet.


Removed
=======

API and Feature Removals
------------------------

* ``inspect.getargspec()`` was removed (was deprecated since CPython 3.0).
  :func:`inspect.getfullargspec` is an almost drop in replacement.

* ``inspect.getmoduleinfo()`` was removed (was deprecated since CPython 3.3).
  :func:`inspect.getmodulename` should be used for obtaining the module
  name for a given path.


Porting to Python 3.6
=====================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.

Changes in the Python API
-------------------------

* Reading the :attr:`~urllib.parse.SplitResult.port` attribute of
  :func:`urllib.parse.urlsplit` and :func:`~urllib.parse.urlparse` results
  now raises :exc:`ValueError` for out-of-range values, rather than
  returning :const:`None`.  See :issue:`20059`.


Changes in the C API
--------------------

* None yet.
