****************************
  What's new in Python 3.14
****************************

:Editor: TBD

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the issue number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :gh:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the VCS log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.14, compared to 3.13.

For full details, see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.14 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.


Summary -- release highlights
=============================

.. This section singles out the most important changes in Python 3.14.
   Brevity is key.


.. PEP-sized items next.

* :ref:`PEP 649: deferred evaluation of annotations <whatsnew314-pep649>`
* :ref:`PEP 741: Python Configuration C API <whatsnew314-pep741>`


New features
============

.. _whatsnew314-pep649:

PEP 649: deferred evaluation of annotations
-------------------------------------------

The :term:`annotations <annotation>` on functions, classes, and modules are no
longer evaluated eagerly. Instead, annotations are stored in special-purpose
:term:`annotate functions <annotate function>` and evaluated only when
necessary. This is specified in :pep:`649` and :pep:`749`.

This change is designed to make annotations in Python more performant and more
usable in most circumstances. The runtime cost for defining annotations is
minimized, but it remains possible to introspect annotations at runtime.
It is usually no longer necessary to enclose annotations in strings if they
contain forward references.

The new :mod:`annotationlib` module provides tools for inspecting deferred
annotations. Annotations may be evaluated in the :attr:`~annotationlib.Format.VALUE`
format (which evaluates annotations to runtime values, similar to the behavior in
earlier Python versions), the :attr:`~annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF` format
(which replaces undefined names with special markers), and the
:attr:`~annotationlib.Format.STRING` format (which returns annotations as strings).

This example shows how these formats behave:

.. doctest::

   >>> from annotationlib import get_annotations, Format
   >>> def func(arg: Undefined):
   ...     pass
   >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.VALUE)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
   NameError: name 'Undefined' is not defined
   >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.FORWARDREF)
   {'arg': ForwardRef('Undefined')}
   >>> get_annotations(func, format=Format.STRING)
   {'arg': 'Undefined'}

Implications for annotated code
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you define annotations in your code (for example, for use with a static type
checker), then this change probably does not affect you: you can keep
writing annotations the same way you did with previous versions of Python.

You will likely be able to remove quoted strings in annotations, which are frequently
used for forward references. Similarly, if you use ``from __future__ import annotations``
to avoid having to write strings in annotations, you may well be able to
remove that import. However, if you rely on third-party libraries that read annotations,
those libraries may need changes to support unquoted annotations before they
work as expected.

Implications for readers of ``__annotations__``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your code reads the ``__annotations__`` attribute on objects, you may want
to make changes in order to support code that relies on deferred evaluation of
annotations. For example, you may want to use :func:`annotationlib.get_annotations`
with the :attr:`~annotationlib.Format.FORWARDREF` format, as the :mod:`dataclasses`
module now does.

Related changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The changes in Python 3.14 are designed to rework how ``__annotations__``
works at runtime while minimizing breakage to code that contains
annotations in source code and to code that reads ``__annotations__``. However,
if you rely on undocumented details of the annotation behavior or on private
functions in the standard library, there are many ways in which your code may
not work in Python 3.14. To safeguard your code against future changes,
use only the documented functionality of the :mod:`annotationlib` module.

``from __future__ import annotations``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In Python 3.7, :pep:`563` introduced the ``from __future__ import annotations``
directive, which turns all annotations into strings. This directive is now
considered deprecated and it is expected to be removed in a future version of Python.
However, this removal will not happen until after Python 3.13, the last version of
Python without deferred evaluation of annotations, reaches its end of life in 2029.
In Python 3.14, the behavior of code using ``from __future__ import annotations``
is unchanged.


Improved error messages
-----------------------

* When unpacking assignment fails due to incorrect number of variables, the
  error message prints the received number of values in more cases than before.
  (Contributed by Tushar Sadhwani in :gh:`122239`.)

  .. code-block:: pycon

     >>> x, y, z = 1, 2, 3, 4
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
         x, y, z = 1, 2, 3, 4
         ^^^^^^^
     ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 3, got 4)


.. _whatsnew314-pep741:

PEP 741: Python Configuration C API
-----------------------------------

Add a :ref:`PyInitConfig C API <pyinitconfig_api>` to configure the Python
initialization without relying on C structures and the ability to make
ABI-compatible changes in the future.

Complete the :pep:`587` :ref:`PyConfig C API <pyconfig_api>` by adding
:c:func:`PyInitConfig_AddModule` which can be used to add a built-in extension
module; feature previously referred to as the “inittab”.

Add :c:func:`PyConfig_Get` and :c:func:`PyConfig_Set` functions to get and set
the current runtime configuration.

PEP 587 “Python Initialization Configuration” unified all the ways to configure
the Python initialization. This PEP unifies also the configuration of the
Python preinitialization and the Python initialization in a single API.
Moreover, this PEP only provides a single choice to embed Python, instead of
having two “Python” and “Isolated” choices (PEP 587), to simplify the API
further.

The lower level PEP 587 PyConfig API remains available for use cases with an
intentionally higher level of coupling to CPython implementation details (such
as emulating the full functionality of CPython’s CLI, including its
configuration mechanisms).

   :pep:`741`.


Other language changes
======================

* The :func:`map` built-in now has an optional keyword-only *strict* flag
  like :func:`zip` to check that all the iterables are of equal length.
  (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in :gh:`119793`.)

* Incorrect usage of :keyword:`await` and asynchronous comprehensions
  is now detected even if the code is optimized away by the :option:`-O`
  command-line option. For example, ``python -O -c 'assert await 1'``
  now produces a :exc:`SyntaxError`. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`121637`.)

* Writes to ``__debug__`` are now detected even if the code is optimized
  away by the :option:`-O` command-line option. For example,
  ``python -O -c 'assert (__debug__ := 1)'`` now produces a
  :exc:`SyntaxError`. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`122245`.)

* Add class methods :meth:`float.from_number` and :meth:`complex.from_number`
  to convert a number to :class:`float` or :class:`complex` type correspondingly.
  They raise an error if the argument is a string.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`84978`.)

* Implement mixed-mode arithmetic rules combining real and complex numbers as
  specified by C standards since C99.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`69639`.)

* All Windows code pages are now supported as "cpXXX" codecs on Windows.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`123803`.)

* :class:`super` objects are now :mod:`pickleable <pickle>` and
  :mod:`copyable <copy>`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`125767`.)

* The :class:`memoryview` type now supports subscription,
  making it a :term:`generic type`.
  (Contributed by Brian Schubert in :gh:`126012`.)


New modules
===========

* :mod:`annotationlib`: For introspecting :term:`annotations <annotation>`.
  See :pep:`749` for more details.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`119180`.)


Improved modules
================

argparse
--------

* The default value of the :ref:`program name <prog>` for
  :class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` now reflects the way the Python
  interpreter was instructed to find the ``__main__`` module code.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Alyssa Coghlan in :gh:`66436`.)

* Introduced the optional *suggest_on_error* parameter to
  :class:`argparse.ArgumentParser`, enabling suggestions for argument choices
  and subparser names if mistyped by the user.
  (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in :gh:`124456`.)

ast
---

* Add :func:`ast.compare` for comparing two ASTs.
  (Contributed by Batuhan Taskaya and Jeremy Hylton in :gh:`60191`.)

* Add support for :func:`copy.replace` for AST nodes.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`121141`.)

* Docstrings are now removed from an optimized AST in optimization level 2.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`123958`.)

* The ``repr()`` output for AST nodes now includes more information.
  (Contributed by Tomas R in :gh:`116022`.)

concurrent.futures
------------------

* Add :class:`~concurrent.futures.InterpreterPoolExecutor`,
  which exposes "subinterpreters (multiple Python interpreters in the
  same process) to Python code.  This is separate from the proposed API
  in :pep:`734`.
  (Contributed by Eric Snow in :gh:`124548`.)
* The default ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` start method (see
  :ref:`multiprocessing-start-methods`) changed from *fork* to *forkserver* on
  platforms other than macOS & Windows. If you require the threading
  incompatible *fork* start method you must explicitly request it by
  supplying a *mp_context* to :class:`concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor`.
  (Contributed by Gregory P.  Smith in :gh:`84559`.)

ctypes
------

* The layout of :ref:`bit fields <ctypes-bit-fields-in-structures-unions>`
  in :class:`~ctypes.Structure` and :class:`~ctypes.Union`
  now matches platform defaults (GCC/Clang or MVSC) more closely.
  In particular, fields no longer overlap.
  (Contributed by Matthias Görgens in :gh:`97702`.)

* The :attr:`.Structure._layout_` class attribute can now be set
  to help match a non-default ABI.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`97702`.)

* On Windows, the :exc:`~ctypes.COMError` exception is now public.
  (Contributed by Jun Komoda in :gh:`126686`.)

* On Windows, the :func:`~ctypes.CopyComPointer` function is now public.
  (Contributed by Jun Komoda in :gh:`127275`.)

  (Contributed by Wannes Boeykens in :gh:`41431`.)

decimal
-------

* Add alternative :class:`~decimal.Decimal` constructor
  :meth:`Decimal.from_number() <decimal.Decimal.from_number>`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`121798`.)

dis
---

* Add support for rendering full source location information of
  :class:`instructions <dis.Instruction>`, rather than only the line number.
  This feature is added to the following interfaces via the *show_positions*
  keyword argument:

  - :class:`dis.Bytecode`
  - :func:`dis.dis`
  - :func:`dis.distb`
  - :func:`dis.disassemble`

  This feature is also exposed via :option:`dis --show-positions`.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`123165`.)

errno
-----

* Add :data:`errno.EHWPOISON` error code.
  (Contributed by James Roy in :gh:`126585`.)

fractions
---------

* Add support for converting any objects that have the
  :meth:`!as_integer_ratio` method to a :class:`~fractions.Fraction`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`82017`.)

* Add alternative :class:`~fractions.Fraction` constructor
  :meth:`Fraction.from_number() <fractions.Fraction.from_number>`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`121797`.)


functools
---------

* Add support to :func:`functools.partial` and
  :func:`functools.partialmethod` for :data:`functools.Placeholder` sentinels
  to reserve a place for positional arguments.
  (Contributed by Dominykas Grigonis in :gh:`119127`.)

* Allow the *initial* parameter of :func:`functools.reduce` to be passed
  as a keyword argument.
  (Contributed by Sayandip Dutta in :gh:`125916`.)


getopt
------

* Add support for options with optional arguments.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`126374`.)

* Add support for returning intermixed options and non-option arguments in order.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`126390`.)

http
----

* Directory lists and error pages generated by the :mod:`http.server`
  module allow the browser to apply its default dark mode.
  (Contributed by Yorik Hansen in :gh:`123430`.)


inspect
-------

* :func:`inspect.signature` takes a new argument *annotation_format* to control
  the :class:`annotationlib.Format` used for representing annotations.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`101552`.)

* :meth:`inspect.Signature.format` takes a new argument *unquote_annotations*.
  If true, string :term:`annotations <annotation>` are displayed without surrounding quotes.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`101552`.)

* Add function :func:`inspect.ispackage` to determine whether an object is a
  :term:`package` or not.
  (Contributed by Zhikang Yan in :gh:`125634`.)



io
--

* Reading text from a non-blocking stream with ``read`` may now raise a
  :exc:`BlockingIOError` if the operation cannot immediately return bytes.
  (Contributed by Giovanni Siragusa in :gh:`109523`.)


json
----

* Add notes for JSON serialization errors that allow to identify the source
  of the error.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`122163`.)

* Enable the :mod:`json` module to work as a script using the :option:`-m`
  switch: :program:`python -m json`.
  See the :ref:`JSON command-line interface <json-commandline>` documentation.
  (Contributed by Trey Hunner in :gh:`122873`.)


mimetypes
---------

* Add MS and :rfc:`8081` MIME types for fonts:

  * Embedded OpenType: ``application/vnd.ms-fontobject``
  * OpenType Layout (OTF) ``font/otf``
  * TrueType: ``font/ttf``
  * WOFF 1.0 ``font/woff``
  * WOFF 2.0 ``font/woff2``

  (Contributed by Sahil Prajapati and Hugo van Kemenade in :gh:`84852`.)

* Add :rfc:`9559` MIME types for Matroska audiovisual data container
  structures, containing:

  * audio with no video: ``audio/matroska`` (``.mka``)
  * video: ``video/matroska`` (``.mkv``)
  * stereoscopic video: ``video/matroska-3d`` (``.mk3d``)

  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in :gh:`89416`.)

* Add MIME types for images with RFCs:

  * :rfc:`1494`: CCITT Group 3 (``.g3``)
  * :rfc:`3362`: Real-time Facsimile, T.38 (``.t38``)
  * :rfc:`3745`: JPEG 2000 (``.jp2``), extension (``.jpx``) and compound (``.jpm``)
  * :rfc:`3950`: Tag Image File Format Fax eXtended, TIFF-FX (``.tfx``)
  * :rfc:`4047`: Flexible Image Transport System (``.fits``)
  * :rfc:`7903`: Enhanced Metafile (``.emf``) and Windows Metafile (``.wmf``)

  (Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in :gh:`85957`.)


multiprocessing
---------------

* The default start method (see :ref:`multiprocessing-start-methods`) changed
  from *fork* to *forkserver* on platforms other than macOS & Windows where
  it was already *spawn*. If you require the threading incompatible *fork*
  start method you must explicitly request it using a context from
  :func:`multiprocessing.get_context` (preferred) or change the default via
  :func:`multiprocessing.set_start_method`.
  (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith in :gh:`84559`.)
* :mod:`multiprocessing`'s ``"forkserver"`` start method now authenticates
  its control socket to avoid solely relying on filesystem permissions
  to restrict what other processes could cause the forkserver to spawn workers
  and run code.
  (Contributed by Gregory P. Smith for :gh:`97514`.)
* The :ref:`multiprocessing proxy objects <multiprocessing-proxy_objects>`
  for *list* and *dict* types gain previously overlooked missing methods:

   * :meth:`!clear` and :meth:`!copy` for proxies of :class:`list`.
   * :meth:`~dict.fromkeys`, ``reversed(d)``, ``d | {}``, ``{} | d``,
     ``d |= {'b': 2}`` for proxies of :class:`dict`.

  (Contributed by Roy Hyunjin Han for :gh:`103134`.)


operator
--------

* Two new functions :func:`operator.is_none` and :func:`operator.is_not_none`
  have been added, such that ``operator.is_none(obj)`` is equivalent
  to ``obj is None`` and ``operator.is_not_none(obj)`` is equivalent
  to ``obj is not None``.
  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger and Nico Mexis in :gh:`115808`.)


os
--

* Add the :func:`os.reload_environ` function to update :data:`os.environ` and
  :data:`os.environb` with changes to the environment made by
  :func:`os.putenv`, by :func:`os.unsetenv`, or made outside Python in the
  same process.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`120057`.)


pathlib
-------

* Add methods to :class:`pathlib.Path` to recursively copy or move files and
  directories:

  * :meth:`~pathlib.Path.copy` copies a file or directory tree to a destination.
  * :meth:`~pathlib.Path.copy_into` copies *into* a destination directory.
  * :meth:`~pathlib.Path.move` moves a file or directory tree to a destination.
  * :meth:`~pathlib.Path.move_into` moves *into* a destination directory.

  (Contributed by Barney Gale in :gh:`73991`.)

* Add :meth:`pathlib.Path.scandir` to scan a directory and return an iterator
  of :class:`os.DirEntry` objects. This is exactly equivalent to calling
  :func:`os.scandir` on a path object.

  (Contributed by Barney Gale in :gh:`125413`.)


pdb
---

* Hardcoded breakpoints (:func:`breakpoint` and :func:`pdb.set_trace`) now
  reuse the most recent :class:`~pdb.Pdb` instance that calls
  :meth:`~pdb.Pdb.set_trace`, instead of creating a new one each time.
  As a result, all the instance specific data like :pdbcmd:`display` and
  :pdbcmd:`commands` are preserved across hardcoded breakpoints.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in :gh:`121450`.)

* Add a new argument *mode* to :class:`pdb.Pdb`. Disable the ``restart``
  command when :mod:`pdb` is in ``inline`` mode.
  (Contributed by Tian Gao in :gh:`123757`.)

platform
--------

* Add :func:`platform.invalidate_caches` to invalidate the cached results.

  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`122549`.)


pickle
------

* Set the default protocol version on the :mod:`pickle` module to 5.
  For more details, see :ref:`pickle protocols <pickle-protocols>`.

* Add notes for pickle serialization errors that allow to identify the source
  of the error.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`122213`.)

pydoc
-----

* :term:`Annotations <annotation>` in help output are now usually
  displayed in a format closer to that in the original source.
  (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`101552`.)


symtable
--------

* Expose the following :class:`symtable.Symbol` methods:

  * :meth:`~symtable.Symbol.is_comp_cell`
  * :meth:`~symtable.Symbol.is_comp_iter`
  * :meth:`~symtable.Symbol.is_free_class`

  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`120029`.)


sys
---

* The previously undocumented special function :func:`sys.getobjects`,
  which only exists in specialized builds of Python, may now return objects
  from other interpreters than the one it's called in.


tkinter
-------

* Make tkinter widget methods :meth:`!after` and :meth:`!after_idle` accept
  arguments passed by keyword.
  (Contributed by Zhikang Yan in :gh:`126899`.)


unicodedata
-----------

* The Unicode database has been updated to Unicode 16.0.0.


unittest
--------

* unittest discovery supports :term:`namespace package` as start
  directory again. It was removed in Python 3.11.
  (Contributed by Jacob Walls in :gh:`80958`.)


uuid
----

* Add support for UUID version 8 via :func:`uuid.uuid8` as specified
  in :rfc:`9562`.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`89083`.)


.. Add improved modules above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Optimizations
=============

asyncio
-------

* :mod:`asyncio` now uses double linked list implementation for native tasks
  which speeds up execution by 10% on standard pyperformance benchmarks and
  reduces memory usage.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`107803`.)

io
---
* :mod:`io` which provides the built-in :func:`open` makes less system calls
  when opening regular files as well as reading whole files. Reading a small
  operating system cached file in full is up to 15% faster.
  :func:`pathlib.Path.read_bytes` has the most optimizations for reading a
  file's bytes in full. (Contributed by Cody Maloney and Victor Stinner in
  :gh:`120754` and :gh:`90102`.)

Deprecated
==========

* :mod:`argparse`:

  * Passing the undocumented keyword argument *prefix_chars* to
    :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group` is now
    deprecated.
    (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in :gh:`125563`.)
  * Deprecated the :class:`argparse.FileType` type converter.
    Anything with resource management should be done downstream after the
    arguments are parsed.
    (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`58032`.)

* :mod:`asyncio`:
  :func:`!asyncio.iscoroutinefunction` is deprecated
  and will be removed in Python 3.16,
  use :func:`inspect.iscoroutinefunction` instead.
  (Contributed by Jiahao Li and Kumar Aditya in :gh:`122875`.)

* :mod:`builtins`:
  Passing a complex number as the *real* or *imag* argument in the
  :func:`complex` constructor is now deprecated; it should only be passed
  as a single positional argument.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`109218`.)

* :mod:`os`:
  :term:`Soft deprecate <soft deprecated>` :func:`os.popen` and
  :func:`os.spawn* <os.spawnl>` functions. They should no longer be used to
  write new code.  The :mod:`subprocess` module is recommended instead.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`120743`.)

* :mod:`symtable`:
  Deprecate :meth:`symtable.Class.get_methods` due to the lack of interest.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`119698`.)

* :mod:`urllib.parse`:
  Accepting objects with false values (like ``0`` and ``[]``) except empty
  strings, byte-like objects and ``None`` in :mod:`urllib.parse` functions
  :func:`~urllib.parse.parse_qsl` and :func:`~urllib.parse.parse_qs` is now
  deprecated.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`116897`.)

Removed
=======

argparse
--------

* Remove the *type*, *choices*, and *metavar* parameters
  of :class:`!argparse.BooleanOptionalAction`.
  They were deprecated since 3.12.

* Calling :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group` on an argument
  group, and calling :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_argument_group` or
  :meth:`~argparse.ArgumentParser.add_mutually_exclusive_group` on a mutually
  exclusive group now raise exceptions. This nesting was never supported,
  often failed to work correctly, and was unintentionally exposed through
  inheritance. This functionality has been deprecated since Python 3.11.
  (Contributed by Savannah Ostrowski in :gh:`127186`.)

ast
---

* Remove the following classes. They were all deprecated since Python 3.8,
  and have emitted deprecation warnings since Python 3.12:

  * :class:`!ast.Bytes`
  * :class:`!ast.Ellipsis`
  * :class:`!ast.NameConstant`
  * :class:`!ast.Num`
  * :class:`!ast.Str`

  Use :class:`ast.Constant` instead. As a consequence of these removals,
  user-defined ``visit_Num``, ``visit_Str``, ``visit_Bytes``,
  ``visit_NameConstant`` and ``visit_Ellipsis`` methods on custom
  :class:`ast.NodeVisitor` subclasses will no longer be called when the
  :class:`!NodeVisitor` subclass is visiting an AST. Define a ``visit_Constant``
  method instead.

  Also, remove the following deprecated properties on :class:`ast.Constant`,
  which were present for compatibility with the now-removed AST classes:

  * :attr:`!ast.Constant.n`
  * :attr:`!ast.Constant.s`

  Use :attr:`!ast.Constant.value` instead.

  (Contributed by Alex Waygood in :gh:`119562`.)

asyncio
-------

* Remove the following classes and functions. They were all deprecated and
  emitted deprecation warnings since Python 3.12:

  * :func:`!asyncio.get_child_watcher`
  * :func:`!asyncio.set_child_watcher`

  It now raises a :exc:`RuntimeError` if there is no current event loop.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`126353`.)


collections.abc
---------------

* Remove :class:`!collections.abc.ByteString`. It had previously raised a
  :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.12.

email

  * :class:`!importlib.abc.ResourceReader`
  * :class:`!importlib.abc.Traversable`
  * :class:`!importlib.abc.TraversableResources`

  Use :mod:`importlib.resources.abc` classes instead:

  * :class:`importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources`

  (Contributed by Jason R. Coombs and Hugo van Kemenade in :gh:`93963`.)

itertools
---------

* Remove :mod:`itertools` support for copy, deepcopy, and pickle operations.
  These had previously raised a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.12.
  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in :gh:`101588`.)

pathlib
-------

* Remove support for passing additional keyword arguments to
  :class:`pathlib.Path`. In previous versions, any such arguments are ignored.
* Remove support for passing additional positional arguments to
  :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.relative_to` and
  :meth:`~pathlib.PurePath.is_relative_to`. In previous versions, any such
  arguments are joined onto *other*.

pkgutil
-------

* Remove deprecated :func:`!pkgutil.get_loader` and :func:`!pkgutil.find_loader`.
  These had previously raised a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.12.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`97850`.)

pty
---

* Remove deprecated :func:`!pty.master_open` and :func:`!pty.slave_open`.

------

* Remove deprecated :class:`!Quoter` class from :mod:`urllib.parse`.
  It had previously raised a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.11.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`118827`.)
* Remove deprecated :class:`!URLopener` and :class:`!FancyURLopener` classes
  from :mod:`urllib.request`. They had previously raised a
  :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.3.

  ``myopener.open()`` can be replaced with :func:`~urllib.request.urlopen`,
  and ``myopener.retrieve()`` can be replaced with
  :func:`~urllib.request.urlretrieve`. Customizations to the opener
  classes can be replaced by passing customized handlers to
  :func:`~urllib.request.build_opener`.

  (Contributed by Barney Gale in :gh:`84850`.)

Others
------

  It had previously raised a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` since Python 3.9. (Contributed
  by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`118767`.)

* The :func:`int` built-in no longer delegates to
  :meth:`~object.__trunc__`. Classes that want to support conversion to
  integer must implement either :meth:`~object.__int__` or
  :meth:`~object.__index__`. (Contributed by Mark Dickinson in :gh:`119743`.)


Porting to Python 3.14
======================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.

Changes in the Python API
-------------------------

* :class:`functools.partial` is now a method descriptor.
  Wrap it in :func:`staticmethod` if you want to preserve the old behavior.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Dominykas Grigonis in :gh:`121027`.)

* The :func:`locale.nl_langinfo` function now sets temporarily the ``LC_CTYPE``
  locale in some cases.
  This temporary change affects other threads.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`69998`.)


Build changes
=============

PEP 761: Discontinuation of PGP signatures
------------------------------------------

PGP signatures will not be available for CPython 3.14 and onwards.
Users verifying artifacts must use `Sigstore verification materials`_ for
verifying CPython artifacts. This change in release process is specified
in :pep:`761`.

.. _Sigstore verification materials: https://www.python.org/downloads/metadata/sigstore/


C API changes
=============

New features
------------

* Add :c:func:`PyLong_GetSign` function to get the sign of :class:`int` objects.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`116560`.)

* Add a new :c:type:`PyUnicodeWriter` API to create a Python :class:`str`
  object:

  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_Create`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_DecodeUTF8Stateful`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_Discard`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_Finish`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_Format`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteChar`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteRepr`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteStr`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteSubstring`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteUCS4`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteUTF8`
  * :c:func:`PyUnicodeWriter_WriteWideChar`

  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`119182`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyIter_NextItem` to replace :c:func:`PyIter_Next`,
  which has an ambiguous return value.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel and Erlend Aasland in :gh:`105201`.)

* :c:func:`Py_Finalize` now deletes all interned strings. This
  is backwards incompatible to any C-Extension that holds onto an interned
  string after a call to :c:func:`Py_Finalize` and is then reused after a
  call to :c:func:`Py_Initialize`.  Any issues arising from this behavior will
  normally result in crashes during the execution of the subsequent call to
  :c:func:`Py_Initialize` from accessing uninitialized memory. To fix, use
  an address sanitizer to identify any use-after-free coming from
  an interned string and deallocate it during module shutdown.
  (Contributed by Eddie Elizondo in :gh:`113601`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyLong_IsPositive`, :c:func:`PyLong_IsNegative`
  and :c:func:`PyLong_IsZero` for checking if :c:type:`PyLongObject`
  is positive, negative, or zero, respectively.
  (Contributed by James Roy and Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`126061`.)

* Add new functions to convert C ``<stdint.h>`` numbers from/to Python
  :class:`int`:

  * :c:func:`PyLong_AsInt32`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_AsInt64`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_AsUInt32`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_AsUInt64`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_FromInt32`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_FromInt64`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_FromUInt32`
  * :c:func:`PyLong_FromUInt64`

  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`120389`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyBytes_Join(sep, iterable) <PyBytes_Join>` function,
  similar to ``sep.join(iterable)`` in Python.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`121645`.)

* Add :c:func:`Py_HashBuffer` to compute and return the hash value of a buffer.
  (Contributed by Antoine Pitrou and Victor Stinner in :gh:`122854`.)

* Add functions to get and set the current runtime Python configuration
  (:pep:`741`):

  * :c:func:`PyConfig_Get`
  * :c:func:`PyConfig_GetInt`
  * :c:func:`PyConfig_Set`
  * :c:func:`PyConfig_Names`

  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`107954`.)

* Add functions to configure the Python initialization (:pep:`741`):

  * :c:func:`Py_InitializeFromInitConfig`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_AddModule`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_Create`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_Free`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_FreeStrList`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_GetError`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_GetExitCode`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_GetInt`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_GetStr`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_GetStrList`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_HasOption`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_SetInt`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_SetStr`
  * :c:func:`PyInitConfig_SetStrList`

  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`107954`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyType_GetBaseByToken` and :c:data:`Py_tp_token` slot for easier
  superclass identification, which attempts to resolve the `type checking issue
  <https://peps.python.org/pep-0630/#type-checking>`__ mentioned in :pep:`630`
  (:gh:`124153`).

* Add :c:func:`PyUnicode_Equal` function to the limited C API:
  test if two strings are equal.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`124502`.)


* Add :c:func:`PyType_Freeze` function to make a type immutable.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`121654`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyUnstable_Object_EnableDeferredRefcount` for enabling
  deferred reference counting, as outlined in :pep:`703`.

Porting to Python 3.14
----------------------

* In the limited C API 3.14 and newer, :c:func:`Py_TYPE` and
  :c:func:`Py_REFCNT` are now implemented as an opaque function call to hide
  implementation details.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`120600` and :gh:`124127`.)


Deprecated
----------

* The :c:macro:`!Py_HUGE_VAL` macro is :term:`soft deprecated`,
  use :c:macro:`!Py_INFINITY` instead.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`120026`.)

* Macros :c:macro:`!Py_IS_NAN`, :c:macro:`!Py_IS_INFINITY`
  and :c:macro:`!Py_IS_FINITE` are :term:`soft deprecated`,
  use instead :c:macro:`!isnan`, :c:macro:`!isinf` and
  :c:macro:`!isfinite` available from :file:`math.h`
  since C99.  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`119613`.)

.. Add C API deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

.. include:: ../deprecations/c-api-pending-removal-in-future.rst

Removed
-------

* Creating :c:data:`immutable types <Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE>` with mutable
  bases was deprecated since 3.12 and now raises a :exc:`TypeError`.
