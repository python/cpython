  What's new in Python 3.15

:Editor: TBD

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the issue number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :gh:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the VCS log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.15, compared to 3.14.

For full details, see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.15 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.

New features
============

.. _whatsnew315-sampling-profiler:

High frequency statistical sampling profiler
--------------------------------------------

A new statistical sampling profiler has been added to the :mod:`profile` module as
:mod:`profile.sample`. This profiler enables low-overhead performance analysis of
running Python processes without requiring code modification or process restart.

Unlike deterministic profilers (:mod:`cProfile` and :mod:`profile`) that instrument
every function call, the sampling profiler periodically captures stack traces from
running processes.  This approach provides virtually zero overhead while achieving
sampling rates of **up to 1,000,000 Hz**, making it the fastest sampling profiler
available for Python (at the time of its contribution) and ideal for debugging
performance issues in production environments.

Key features include:

* **Zero-overhead profiling**: Attach to any running Python process without
  affecting its performance
* **No code modification required**: Profile existing applications without restart
* **Real-time statistics**: Monitor sampling quality during data collection
* **Multiple output formats**: Generate both detailed statistics and flamegraph data
* **Thread-aware profiling**: Option to profile all threads or just the main thread

Profile process 1234 for 10 seconds with default settings::

  python -m profile.sample 1234

Profile with custom interval and duration, save to file::

  python -m profile.sample -i 50 -d 30 -o profile.stats 1234

Generate collapsed stacks for flamegraph::

  python -m profile.sample --collapsed 1234

Profile all threads and sort by total time::

  python -m profile.sample -a --sort-tottime 1234

The profiler generates statistical estimates of where time is spent::

  Real-time sampling stats: Mean: 100261.5Hz (9.97µs) Min: 86333.4Hz (11.58µs) Max: 118807.2Hz (8.42µs) Samples: 400001
  Captured 498841 samples in 5.00 seconds

  Summary of Interesting Functions:

  Functions with Highest Direct/Cumulative Ratio (Hot Spots):

    1.000 direct/cumulative ratio, 27.2% direct samples: ast.py:(parse)
    1.000 direct/cumulative ratio, 3.6% direct samples: subprocess.py:(Popen._execute_child)

  Functions with Highest Call Frequency (Indirect Calls):
    418815 indirect calls, 87.9% total stack presence: case.py:(TestCase.run)
    415519 indirect calls, 87.9% total stack presence: case.py:(TestCase._callTestMethod)
    159470 indirect calls, 33.5% total stack presence: test_compile.py:(TestSpecifics.test_compiler_recursion_limit)

  Functions with Highest Call Magnification (Cumulative/Direct):
    12267.9x call magnification, 159470 indirect calls from 13 direct: test_compile.py:(TestSpecifics.test_compiler_recursion_limit)
    10581.7x call magnification, 116388 indirect calls from 11 direct: test_ast.py:(AST_Tests.test_ast_recursion_limit)
    9740.9x call magnification, 418815 indirect calls from 43 direct: case.py:(TestCase.run)

The profiler automatically identifies performance bottlenecks through statistical
analysis, highlighting functions with high CPU usage and call frequency patterns.

This capability is particularly valuable for debugging performance issues in
production systems where traditional profiling approaches would be too intrusive.

Other language changes
======================

* Python now uses UTF-8_ as the default encoding, independent of the system's
  environment. This means that I/O operations without an explicit encoding,
  e.g. ``open('flying-circus.txt')``, will use UTF-8.
  UTF-8 is a widely-supported Unicode_ character encoding that has become a
  *de facto* standard for representing text, including nearly every webpage
  on the internet, many common file formats, programming languages, and more.

  This only applies when no ``encoding`` argument is given. For best
  compatibility between versions of Python, ensure that an explicit ``encoding``
  argument is always provided. The :ref:`opt-in encoding warning <io-encoding-warning>`
  can be used to identify code that may be affected by this change.
  The special special ``encoding='locale'`` argument uses the current locale
  encoding, and has been supported since Python 3.10.

  To retain the previous behaviour, Python's UTF-8 mode may be disabled with
  the :envvar:`PYTHONUTF8=0 <PYTHONUTF8>` environment variable or the
  :option:`-X utf8=0 <-X>` command line option.

  .. seealso:: :pep:`686` for further details.

  .. _UTF-8: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
  .. _Unicode: https://home.unicode.org/

  (Contributed by Adam Turner in :gh:`133711`; PEP 686 written by Inada Naoki.)

* Several error messages incorrectly using the term "argument" have been corrected.
  (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych in :gh:`133382`.)


New modules
===========

* None yet.


Improved modules
================

dbm
---

* Added new :meth:`!reorganize` methods to :mod:`dbm.dumb` and :mod:`dbm.sqlite3`
  which allow to recover unused free space previously occupied by deleted entries.
  (Contributed by Andrea Oliveri in :gh:`134004`.)

* Add the ``'m'`` flag for :func:`dbm.gnu.open` which allows to disable
  the use of :manpage:`mmap(2)`.
  This may harm performance, but improve crash tolerance.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`66234`.)

difflib
-------

* Improved the styling of HTML diff pages generated by the :class:`difflib.HtmlDiff`
  class, and migrated the output to the HTML5 standard.
  (Contributed by Jiahao Li in :gh:`134580`.)


http.client
-----------

* A new *max_response_headers* keyword-only parameter has been added to
  :class:`~http.client.HTTPConnection` and :class:`~http.client.HTTPSConnection`
  constructors. This parameter overrides the default maximum number of allowed
  response headers.
  (Contributed by Alexander Enrique Urieles Nieto in :gh:`131724`.)


math
----

* Add :func:`math.isnormal` and :func:`math.issubnormal` functions.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`132908`.)

  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`135853`.)


os.path
-------

* The *strict* parameter to :func:`os.path.realpath` accepts a new value,
  :data:`os.path.ALLOW_MISSING`.
  If used, errors other than :exc:`FileNotFoundError` will be re-raised;
  the resulting path can be missing but it will be free of symlinks.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for :cve:`2025-4517`.)


shelve
------

* Added new :meth:`!reorganize` method to :mod:`shelve` used to recover unused free
  space previously occupied by deleted entries.
  (Contributed by Andrea Oliveri in :gh:`134004`.)


sqlite3
-------

* The :ref:`command-line interface <sqlite3-cli>` has several new features:

   * SQL keyword completion on <tab>.
     (Contributed by Long Tan in :gh:`133393`.)

   * Prompts, error messages, and help text are now colored.
     This is enabled by default, see :ref:`using-on-controlling-color` for
     details.
     (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych and Łukasz Langa in :gh:`133461`)


ssl
---

* Indicate through :data:`ssl.HAS_PSK_TLS13` whether the :mod:`ssl` module
  supports "External PSKs" in TLSv1.3, as described in RFC 9258.
  (Contributed by Will Childs-Klein in :gh:`133624`.)


tarfile
-------

* :func:`~tarfile.data_filter` now normalizes symbolic link targets in order to
  avoid path traversal attacks.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`127987` and :cve:`2025-4138`.)
* :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extractall` now skips fixing up directory attributes
  when a directory was removed or replaced by another kind of file.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`127987` and :cve:`2024-12718`.)
* :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extract` and :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extractall`
  now (re-)apply the extraction filter when substituting a link (hard or
  symbolic) with a copy of another archive member, and when fixing up
  directory attributes.
  The former raises a new exception, :exc:`~tarfile.LinkFallbackError`.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for :cve:`2025-4330` and :cve:`2024-12718`.)
* :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extract` and :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extractall`
  no longer extract rejected members when
  :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.errorlevel` is zero.
  (Contributed by Matt Prodani and Petr Viktorin in :gh:`112887`
  and :cve:`2025-4435`.)


types
------

* Expose the write-through :func:`locals` proxy type
  as :data:`types.FrameLocalsProxyType`.
  This represents the type of the :attr:`frame.f_locals` attribute,
  as described in :pep:`667`.


unittest
--------

* :func:`unittest.TestCase.assertLogs` will now accept a formatter
  to control how messages are formatted.
  (Contributed by Garry Cairns in :gh:`134567`.)


zlib
----

* Allow combining two Adler-32 checksums via :func:`~zlib.adler32_combine`.
  (Contributed by Callum Attryde and Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134635`.)

* Allow combining two CRC-32 checksums via :func:`~zlib.crc32_combine`.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134635`.)


.. Add improved modules above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Optimizations
=============

module_name
-----------

* TODO



Deprecated
==========

hashlib
-------

* In hash function constructors such as :func:`~hashlib.new` or the
  direct hash-named constructors such as :func:`~hashlib.md5` and
  :func:`~hashlib.sha256`, their optional initial data parameter could
  also be passed a keyword argument named ``data=`` or ``string=`` in
  various :mod:`hashlib` implementations.

  Support for the ``string`` keyword argument name is now deprecated and
  is slated for removal in Python 3.19. Prefer passing the initial data as
  a positional argument for maximum backwards compatibility.

  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134978`.)


.. Add deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Removed
=======

ctypes

  implementation of :class:`~threading.RLock` objects. This was deprecated
  in Python 3.14.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134087`.)


typing
------

* The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating
  :class:`~typing.NamedTuple` classes (for example,
  ``Point = NamedTuple("Point", x=int, y=int)``) is no longer supported.
  Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133817`.)

* Using ``TD = TypedDict("TD")`` or ``TD = TypedDict("TD", None)`` to
  construct a :class:`~typing.TypedDict` type with zero field is no
  longer supported. Use ``class TD(TypedDict): pass``
  or ``TD = TypedDict("TD", {})`` instead.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133823`.)


wave
----

* Removed the ``getmark()``, ``setmark()`` and ``getmarkers()`` methods
  of the :class:`~wave.Wave_read` and :class:`~wave.Wave_write` classes,

Porting to Python 3.15
======================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.


Build changes
=============

* Removed implicit fallback to the bundled copy of the ``libmpdec`` library.
  Now this should be explicitly enabled with :option:`--with-system-libmpdec`
  set to ``no`` or with :option:`!--without-system-libmpdec`.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`115119`.)


C API changes
=============

New features

  * The first parameter of methods :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_authorizer`,
    :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler` and
    :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_trace_callback` is now positional-only.

  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`133595`.)

* Private functions promoted to public C APIs:

  * ``PyMutex_IsLocked()`` : :c:func:`PyMutex_IsLocked`

  The |pythoncapi_compat_project| can be used to get most of these new
  functions on Python 3.14 and older.


Deprecated C APIs
-----------------

* For unsigned integer formats in :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple`,
  accepting Python integers with value that is larger than the maximal value
  for the C type or less than the minimal value for the corresponding
  signed integer type of the same size is now deprecated.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`132629`.)

.. Add C API deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Removed C APIs
--------------

* Remove deprecated ``PyUnicode`` functions:

  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsDecodedObject`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Decode` instead.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsDecodedUnicode`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Decode` instead; Note that some codecs (for example, "base64")
    may return a type other than :class:`str`, such as :class:`bytes`.

The |pythoncapi_compat_project| can be used to get :c:func:`!PyConfig_Get`
on Python 3.13 and older.

* Python initialization functions:

  * :c:func:`!Py_GetExecPrefix`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("base_exec_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.base_exec_prefix`) instead.
    Use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("exec_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.exec_prefix`) if :ref:`virtual environments <venv-def>`
    need to be handled.
