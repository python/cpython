  What's new in Python 3.15
****************************

:Editor: TBD

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the issue number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :gh:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the VCS log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.15, compared to 3.14.

For full details, see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.15 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.


Summary --- release highlights
==============================

.. This section singles out the most important changes in Python 3.15.
   Brevity is key.


.. PEP-sized items next.



New features
============



Other language changes
======================

* Several error messages incorrectly using the term "argument" have been corrected.
  (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych in :gh:`133382`.)



New modules
===========

* None yet.


Improved modules
================

ssl
---

* Indicate through :data:`ssl.HAS_PSK_TLS13` whether the :mod:`ssl` module
  supports "External PSKs" in TLSv1.3, as described in RFC 9258.
  (Contributed by Will Childs-Klein in :gh:`133624`.)


.. Add improved modules above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Optimizations
=============

module_name
-----------

* TODO



Deprecated
==========

.. Add deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Removed
=======

http.server
-----------

* Removed the :class:`!CGIHTTPRequestHandler` class
  and the ``--cgi`` flag from the :program:`python -m http.server`
  command-line interface. They were deprecated in Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133810`.)


platform
--------

* Removed the :func:`!platform.java_ver` function,
  which was deprecated since Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Alexey Makridenko in :gh:`133604`.)


sysconfig
---------

* Removed the *check_home* parameter of :func:`sysconfig.is_python_build`.
  (Contributed by Filipe Laíns in :gh:`92897`.)


threading
---------

* Remove support for arbitrary positional or keyword arguments in the C
  implementation of :class:`~threading.RLock` objects. This was deprecated
  in Python 3.14.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134087`.)


typing
------

* The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating
  :class:`~typing.NamedTuple` classes (for example,
  ``Point = NamedTuple("Point", x=int, y=int)``) is no longer supported.
  Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133817`.)

* Using ``TD = TypedDict("TD")`` or ``TD = TypedDict("TD", None)`` to
  construct a :class:`~typing.TypedDict` type with zero field is no
  longer supported. Use ``class TD(TypedDict): pass``
  or ``TD = TypedDict("TD", {})`` instead.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133823`.)


wave
----

* Removed the ``getmark()``, ``setmark()`` and ``getmarkers()`` methods
  of the :class:`~wave.Wave_read` and :class:`~wave.Wave_write` classes,
  which were deprecated since Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133873`.)


Porting to Python 3.15
======================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.


Build changes
=============


C API changes
=============

New features
------------

* TODO

Porting to Python 3.15
----------------------

* :class:`sqlite3.Connection` APIs has been cleaned up.

  * All parameters of :func:`sqlite3.connect` except *database* are now keyword-only.
  * The first three parameters of methods :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.create_function`
    and :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate` are now positional-only.
  * The first parameter of methods :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_authorizer`,
    :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler` and
    :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_trace_callback` is now positional-only.

  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`133595`.)

Deprecated C APIs
-----------------

* TODO

.. Add C API deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Removed C APIs
--------------

* Remove deprecated ``PyUnicode`` functions:

  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsDecodedObject`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Decode` instead.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsDecodedUnicode`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Decode` instead; Note that some codecs (for example, "base64")
    may return a type other than :class:`str`, such as :class:`bytes`.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsEncodedObject`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Encode` instead.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsEncodedUnicode`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Encode` instead; Note that some codecs (for example, "base64")
    may return a type other than :class:`bytes`, such as :class:`str`.

  (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych in :gh:`133612`)

* :c:func:`!PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock`: deprecated alias
  of :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModule`.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133644`.)

The following functions are removed in favor of :c:func:`PyConfig_Get`.
The |pythoncapi_compat_project| can be used to get :c:func:`!PyConfig_Get`
on Python 3.13 and older.

* Python initialization functions:

  * :c:func:`!Py_GetExecPrefix`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("base_exec_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.base_exec_prefix`) instead.
    Use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("exec_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.exec_prefix`) if :ref:`virtual environments <venv-def>`
    need to be handled.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetPath`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("module_search_paths") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.path`) instead.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetPrefix`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("base_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.base_prefix`) instead.
    Use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.prefix`) if :ref:`virtual environments <venv-def>`
    need to be handled.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetProgramFullPath`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("executable") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.executable`) instead.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetProgramName`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("executable") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.executable`) instead.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetPythonHome`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("home") <PyConfig_Get>` or the
    :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` environment variable instead.
