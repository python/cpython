  What's new in Python 3.15
****************************

:Editor: TBD

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the issue number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :gh:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the VCS log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.15, compared to 3.14.

For full details, see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.15 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.


Summary --- release highlights
==============================

.. This section singles out the most important changes in Python 3.15.
   Brevity is key.


.. PEP-sized items next.



New features
============

.. _whatsnew315-sampling-profiler:

High frequency statistical sampling profiler
--------------------------------------------

A new statistical sampling profiler has been added to the :mod:`profile` module as
:mod:`profile.sample`. This profiler enables low-overhead performance analysis of
running Python processes without requiring code modification or process restart.

Unlike deterministic profilers (:mod:`cProfile` and :mod:`profile`) that instrument
every function call, the sampling profiler periodically captures stack traces from
running processes.  This approach provides virtually zero overhead while achieving
sampling rates of **up to 1,000,000 Hz**, making it the fastest sampling profiler
available for Python (at the time of its contribution) and ideal for debugging
performance issues in production environments.

Key features include:

* **Zero-overhead profiling**: Attach to any running Python process without
  affecting its performance
* **No code modification required**: Profile existing applications without restart
* **Real-time statistics**: Monitor sampling quality during data collection
* **Multiple output formats**: Generate both detailed statistics and flamegraph data
* **Thread-aware profiling**: Option to profile all threads or just the main thread

Profile process 1234 for 10 seconds with default settings::

  python -m profile.sample 1234

Profile with custom interval and duration, save to file::

  python -m profile.sample -i 50 -d 30 -o profile.stats 1234

Generate collapsed stacks for flamegraph::

  python -m profile.sample --collapsed 1234

Profile all threads and sort by total time::

  python -m profile.sample -a --sort-tottime 1234

The profiler generates statistical estimates of where time is spent::

  Real-time sampling stats: Mean: 100261.5Hz (9.97µs) Min: 86333.4Hz (11.58µs) Max: 118807.2Hz (8.42µs) Samples: 400001
  Captured 498841 samples in 5.00 seconds

    415519 indirect calls, 87.9% total stack presence: case.py:(TestCase._callTestMethod)
    159470 indirect calls, 33.5% total stack presence: test_compile.py:(TestSpecifics.test_compiler_recursion_limit)

  Functions with Highest Call Magnification (Cumulative/Direct):

    10581.7x call magnification, 116388 indirect calls from 11 direct: test_ast.py:(AST_Tests.test_ast_recursion_limit)
    9740.9x call magnification, 418815 indirect calls from 43 direct: case.py:(TestCase.run)

The profiler automatically identifies performance bottlenecks through statistical
analysis, highlighting functions with high CPU usage and call frequency patterns.

This capability is particularly valuable for debugging performance issues in
production systems where traditional profiling approaches would be too intrusive.

Improved error messages
-----------------------

* The interpreter now provides more helpful suggestions in :exc:`AttributeError`
  exceptions when accessing an attribute on an object that does not exist, but
  a similar attribute is available through one of its members.

  For example, if the object has an attribute that itself exposes the requested
  name, the error message will suggest accessing it via that inner attribute:

  .. code-block:: python

     @dataclass
     class Circle:
        radius: float

        @property
        def area(self) -> float:
           return pi * self.radius**2

     class Container:
        def __init__(self, inner: Circle) -> None:
           self.inner = inner

     circle = Circle(radius=4.0)
     container = Container(circle)
     print(container.area)

  Running this code now produces a clearer suggestion:

  .. code-block:: pycon

     Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "/home/pablogsal/github/python/main/lel.py", line 42, in <module>
        print(container.area)
              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
     AttributeError: 'Container' object has no attribute 'area'. Did you mean: 'inner.area'?


Other language changes
======================

* Python now uses UTF-8_ as the default encoding, independent of the system's
  environment. This means that I/O operations without an explicit encoding,
  e.g. ``open('flying-circus.txt')``, will use UTF-8.
  UTF-8 is a widely-supported Unicode_ character encoding that has become a
  *de facto* standard for representing text, including nearly every webpage
  on the internet, many common file formats, programming languages, and more.

  This only applies when no ``encoding`` argument is given. For best
  compatibility between versions of Python, ensure that an explicit ``encoding``
  argument is always provided. The :ref:`opt-in encoding warning <io-encoding-warning>`
  can be used to identify code that may be affected by this change.
  The special ``encoding='locale'`` argument uses the current locale
  encoding, and has been supported since Python 3.10.

  To retain the previous behaviour, Python's UTF-8 mode may be disabled with
  the :envvar:`PYTHONUTF8=0 <PYTHONUTF8>` environment variable or the
  :option:`-X utf8=0 <-X>` command line option.

  .. seealso:: :pep:`686` for further details.

  .. _UTF-8: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8
  .. _Unicode: https://home.unicode.org/

  (Contributed by Adam Turner in :gh:`133711`; PEP 686 written by Inada Naoki.)

* Several error messages incorrectly using the term "argument" have been corrected.
  (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych in :gh:`133382`.)

* The interpreter now tries to provide a suggestion when
  :func:`delattr` fails due to a missing attribute.
  When an attribute name that closely resembles an existing attribute is used,
  the interpreter will suggest the correct attribute name in the error message.
  For example:

  .. doctest::

     >>> class A:
     ...     pass
     >>> a = A()
     >>> a.abcde = 1
     >>> del a.abcdf  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
     Traceback (most recent call last):
     ...
     AttributeError: 'A' object has no attribute 'abcdf'. Did you mean: 'abcde'?

  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev and Pranjal Prajapati in :gh:`136588`.)

* Unraisable exceptions are now highlighted with color by default. This can be
  controlled by :ref:`environment variables <using-on-controlling-color>`.
  (Contributed by Peter Bierma in :gh:`134170`.)

* The :meth:`~object.__repr__` of :class:`ImportError` and :class:`ModuleNotFoundError`
  now shows "name" and "path" as ``name=<name>`` and ``path=<path>`` if they were given
  as keyword arguments at construction time.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka, Oleg Iarygin, and Yoav Nir in :gh:`74185`.)

* The :attr:`~object.__dict__` and :attr:`!__weakref__` descriptors now use a
  single descriptor instance per interpreter, shared across all types that
  need them.
  This speeds up class creation, and helps avoid reference cycles.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`135228`.)


New modules
===========

* None yet.


Improved modules
================

dbm
---

* Added new :meth:`!reorganize` methods to :mod:`dbm.dumb` and :mod:`dbm.sqlite3`
  which allow to recover unused free space previously occupied by deleted entries.
  (Contributed by Andrea Oliveri in :gh:`134004`.)

* Add the ``'m'`` flag for :func:`dbm.gnu.open` which allows to disable
  the use of :manpage:`mmap(2)`.
  This may harm performance, but improve crash tolerance.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`66234`.)

difflib
-------

  .. _whatsnew315-color-difflib:

* Introduced the optional *color* parameter to :func:`difflib.unified_diff`,
  enabling color output similar to :program:`git diff`.
  This can be controlled by :ref:`environment variables
  <using-on-controlling-color>`.
  (Contributed by Douglas Thor in :gh:`133725`.)

* Improved the styling of HTML diff pages generated by the :class:`difflib.HtmlDiff`
  class, and migrated the output to the HTML5 standard.
  (Contributed by Jiahao Li in :gh:`134580`.)


hashlib
-------

* Ensure that hash functions guaranteed to be always *available* exist as
  attributes of :mod:`hashlib` even if they will not work at runtime due to
  missing backend implementations. For instance, ``hashlib.md5`` will no
  longer raise :exc:`AttributeError` if OpenSSL is not available and Python
  has been built without MD5 support.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`136929`.)


http.client
-----------

* A new *max_response_headers* keyword-only parameter has been added to
  :class:`~http.client.HTTPConnection` and :class:`~http.client.HTTPSConnection`
  constructors. This parameter overrides the default maximum number of allowed
  response headers.
  (Contributed by Alexander Enrique Urieles Nieto in :gh:`131724`.)


http.cookies
------------

* Allow '``"``' double quotes in cookie values.
  (Contributed by Nick Burns and Senthil Kumaran in :gh:`92936`.)


locale
------

* :func:`~locale.setlocale` now supports language codes with ``@``-modifiers.
  ``@``-modifier are no longer silently removed in :func:`~locale.getlocale`,
  but included in the language code.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`137729`.)


math
----

* Add :func:`math.isnormal` and :func:`math.issubnormal` functions.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`132908`.)

* Add :func:`math.fmax`, :func:`math.fmin` and :func:`math.signbit` functions.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`135853`.)


os.path
-------

* Add support of the all-but-last mode in :func:`~os.path.realpath`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`71189`.)

* The *strict* parameter to :func:`os.path.realpath` accepts a new value,
  :data:`os.path.ALLOW_MISSING`.
  If used, errors other than :exc:`FileNotFoundError` will be re-raised;
  the resulting path can be missing but it will be free of symlinks.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for :cve:`2025-4517`.)

resource
--------

* Add new constants: :data:`~resource.RLIMIT_NTHR`,
  :data:`~resource.RLIMIT_UMTXP`, :data:`~resource.RLIMIT_THREADS`,
  :data:`~resource.RLIM_SAVED_CUR`, and :data:`~resource.RLIM_SAVED_MAX`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`137512`.)


shelve
------

* Added new :meth:`!reorganize` method to :mod:`shelve` used to recover unused free
  space previously occupied by deleted entries.
  (Contributed by Andrea Oliveri in :gh:`134004`.)


sqlite3
-------

* The :ref:`command-line interface <sqlite3-cli>` has several new features:

   * SQL keyword completion on <tab>.
     (Contributed by Long Tan in :gh:`133393`.)

   * Prompts, error messages, and help text are now colored.
     This is enabled by default, see :ref:`using-on-controlling-color` for
     details.
     (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych and Łukasz Langa in :gh:`133461`)


ssl
---

* Indicate through :data:`ssl.HAS_PSK_TLS13` whether the :mod:`ssl` module
  supports "External PSKs" in TLSv1.3, as described in RFC 9258.
  (Contributed by Will Childs-Klein in :gh:`133624`.)

* Added new methods for managing groups used for SSL key agreement

   * :meth:`ssl.SSLContext.set_groups` sets the groups allowed for doing
     key agreement, extending the previous
     :meth:`ssl.SSLContext.set_ecdh_curve` method.
     This new API provides the ability to list multiple groups and
     supports fixed-field and post-quantum groups in addition to ECDH
     curves. This method can also be used to control what key shares
     are sent in the TLS handshake.
   * :meth:`ssl.SSLSocket.group` returns the group selected for doing key
     agreement on the current connection after the TLS handshake completes.
     This call requires OpenSSL 3.2 or later.
   * :meth:`ssl.SSLContext.get_groups` returns a list of all available key
     agreement groups compatible with the minimum and maximum TLS versions
     currently set in the context. This call requires OpenSSL 3.5 or later.

   (Contributed by Ron Frederick in :gh:`136306`)


tarfile
-------

* :func:`~tarfile.data_filter` now normalizes symbolic link targets in order to
  avoid path traversal attacks.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`127987` and :cve:`2025-4138`.)
* :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extractall` now skips fixing up directory attributes
  when a directory was removed or replaced by another kind of file.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`127987` and :cve:`2024-12718`.)
* :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extract` and :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extractall`
  now (re-)apply the extraction filter when substituting a link (hard or
  symbolic) with a copy of another archive member, and when fixing up
  directory attributes.
  The former raises a new exception, :exc:`~tarfile.LinkFallbackError`.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin for :cve:`2025-4330` and :cve:`2024-12718`.)
* :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extract` and :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.extractall`
  no longer extract rejected members when
  :func:`~tarfile.TarFile.errorlevel` is zero.
  (Contributed by Matt Prodani and Petr Viktorin in :gh:`112887`
  and :cve:`2025-4435`.)


types
------

* Expose the write-through :func:`locals` proxy type
  as :data:`types.FrameLocalsProxyType`.
  This represents the type of the :attr:`frame.f_locals` attribute,
  as described in :pep:`667`.


unittest
--------

* :func:`unittest.TestCase.assertLogs` will now accept a formatter
  to control how messages are formatted.
  (Contributed by Garry Cairns in :gh:`134567`.)


zlib
----

* Allow combining two Adler-32 checksums via :func:`~zlib.adler32_combine`.
  (Contributed by Callum Attryde and Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134635`.)

* Allow combining two CRC-32 checksums via :func:`~zlib.crc32_combine`.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134635`.)


.. Add improved modules above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Optimizations
=============

module_name
-----------

* TODO



Deprecated
==========

hashlib
-------

* In hash function constructors such as :func:`~hashlib.new` or the
  direct hash-named constructors such as :func:`~hashlib.md5` and
  :func:`~hashlib.sha256`, their optional initial data parameter could
  also be passed a keyword argument named ``data=`` or ``string=`` in
  various :mod:`hashlib` implementations.

  Support for the ``string`` keyword argument name is now deprecated and
  is slated for removal in Python 3.19. Prefer passing the initial data as
  a positional argument for maximum backwards compatibility.

  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134978`.)


.. Add deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Removed
=======

ctypes
------

* Removed the undocumented function :func:`!ctypes.SetPointerType`,
  which has been deprecated since Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133866`.)


glob
----

* Removed the undocumented :func:`!glob.glob0` and :func:`!glob.glob1`
  functions, which have been deprecated since Python 3.13. Use
  :func:`glob.glob` and pass a directory to its *root_dir* argument instead.
  (Contributed by Barney Gale in :gh:`137466`.)


http.server
-----------

* Removed the :class:`!CGIHTTPRequestHandler` class
  and the ``--cgi`` flag from the :program:`python -m http.server`
  command-line interface. They were deprecated in Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133810`.)


pathlib
-------

* Removed deprecated :meth:`!pathlib.PurePath.is_reserved`.
  Use :func:`os.path.isreserved` to detect reserved paths on Windows.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`133875`.)


platform
--------

* Removed the :func:`!platform.java_ver` function,
  which was deprecated since Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Alexey Makridenko in :gh:`133604`.)


sre_*
-----

* Removed :mod:`!sre_compile`, :mod:`!sre_constants` and :mod:`!sre_parse` modules.
  (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych in :gh:`135994`.)


sysconfig
---------

* Removed the *check_home* parameter of :func:`sysconfig.is_python_build`.
  (Contributed by Filipe Laíns in :gh:`92897`.)


threading
---------

* Remove support for arbitrary positional or keyword arguments in the C
  implementation of :class:`~threading.RLock` objects. This was deprecated
  in Python 3.14.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`134087`.)


typing
------

* The undocumented keyword argument syntax for creating
  :class:`~typing.NamedTuple` classes (for example,
  ``Point = NamedTuple("Point", x=int, y=int)``) is no longer supported.
  Use the class-based syntax or the functional syntax instead.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133817`.)

* Using ``TD = TypedDict("TD")`` or ``TD = TypedDict("TD", None)`` to
  construct a :class:`~typing.TypedDict` type with zero field is no
  longer supported. Use ``class TD(TypedDict): pass``
  or ``TD = TypedDict("TD", {})`` instead.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133823`.)

* Code like ``class ExtraTypeVars(P1[S], Protocol[T, T2]): ...`` now raises
  a :exc:`TypeError`, because ``S`` is not listed in ``Protocol`` parameters.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`137191`.)

* Code like ``class B2(A[T2], Protocol[T1, T2]): ...`` now correctly handles
  type parameters order: it is ``(T1, T2)``, not ``(T2, T1)``
  as it was incorrectly infered in runtime before.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`137191`.)


wave
----

* Removed the ``getmark()``, ``setmark()`` and ``getmarkers()`` methods
  of the :class:`~wave.Wave_read` and :class:`~wave.Wave_write` classes,
  which were deprecated since Python 3.13.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133873`.)


Porting to Python 3.15
======================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.


Build changes
=============

* Removed implicit fallback to the bundled copy of the ``libmpdec`` library.
  Now this should be explicitly enabled with :option:`--with-system-libmpdec`
  set to ``no`` or with :option:`!--without-system-libmpdec`.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`115119`.)


C API changes
=============

New features
------------

* Add :c:func:`PySys_GetAttr`, :c:func:`PySys_GetAttrString`,
  :c:func:`PySys_GetOptionalAttr`, and :c:func:`PySys_GetOptionalAttrString`
  functions as replacements for :c:func:`PySys_GetObject`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`108512`.)

* Add :c:type:`PyUnstable_Unicode_GET_CACHED_HASH` to get the cached hash of
  a string. See the documentation for caveats.

Porting to Python 3.15
----------------------

* :class:`sqlite3.Connection` APIs has been cleaned up.

  * All parameters of :func:`sqlite3.connect` except *database* are now keyword-only.
  * The first three parameters of methods :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.create_function`
    and :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.create_aggregate` are now positional-only.
  * The first parameter of methods :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_authorizer`,
    :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_progress_handler` and
    :meth:`~sqlite3.Connection.set_trace_callback` is now positional-only.

  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`133595`.)

* Private functions promoted to public C APIs:

  The |pythoncapi_compat_project| can be used to get most of these new
  functions on Python 3.14 and older.

* :data:`resource.RLIM_INFINITY` is now always positive.
  Passing a negative integer value that corresponded to its old value
  (such as ``-1`` or ``-3``, depending on platform) to
  :func:`resource.setrlimit` and :func:`resource.prlimit` is now deprecated.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`137044`.)


Deprecated C APIs
-----------------

* For unsigned integer formats in :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple`,
  accepting Python integers with value that is larger than the maximal value
  for the C type or less than the minimal value for the corresponding
  signed integer type of the same size is now deprecated.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`132629`.)

* Deprecate :c:member:`~PyComplexObject.cval` field of the the
  :c:type:`PyComplexObject` type.
  Use :c:func:`PyComplex_AsCComplex` and :c:func:`PyComplex_FromCComplex`
  to convert a Python complex number to/from the C :c:type:`Py_complex`
  representation.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`128813`.)

* Functions :c:func:`_Py_c_sum`, :c:func:`_Py_c_diff`, :c:func:`_Py_c_neg`,
  :c:func:`_Py_c_prod`, :c:func:`_Py_c_quot`, :c:func:`_Py_c_pow` and
  :c:func:`_Py_c_abs` are :term:`soft deprecated`.
  (Contributed by Sergey B Kirpichev in :gh:`128813`.)

.. Add C API deprecations above alphabetically, not here at the end.

Removed C APIs
--------------

* Remove deprecated ``PyUnicode`` functions:

  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsDecodedObject`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Decode` instead.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsDecodedUnicode`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Decode` instead; Note that some codecs (for example, "base64")
    may return a type other than :class:`str`, such as :class:`bytes`.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsEncodedObject`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Encode` instead.
  * :c:func:`!PyUnicode_AsEncodedUnicode`:
    Use :c:func:`PyCodec_Encode` instead; Note that some codecs (for example, "base64")
    may return a type other than :class:`bytes`, such as :class:`str`.

  (Contributed by Stan Ulbrych in :gh:`133612`)

* :c:func:`!PyImport_ImportModuleNoBlock`: deprecated alias
  of :c:func:`PyImport_ImportModule`.
  (Contributed by Bénédikt Tran in :gh:`133644`.)

The following functions are removed in favor of :c:func:`PyConfig_Get`.
The |pythoncapi_compat_project| can be used to get :c:func:`!PyConfig_Get`
on Python 3.13 and older.

* Python initialization functions:

  * :c:func:`!Py_GetExecPrefix`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("base_exec_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.base_exec_prefix`) instead.
    Use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("exec_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.exec_prefix`) if :ref:`virtual environments <venv-def>`
    need to be handled.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetPath`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("module_search_paths") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.path`) instead.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetPrefix`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("base_prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.base_prefix`) instead.
    Use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("prefix") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.prefix`) if :ref:`virtual environments <venv-def>`
    need to be handled.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetProgramFullPath`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("executable") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.executable`) instead.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetProgramName`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("executable") <PyConfig_Get>`
    (:data:`sys.executable`) instead.
  * :c:func:`!Py_GetPythonHome`:
    use :c:func:`PyConfig_Get("home") <PyConfig_Get>` or the
    :envvar:`PYTHONHOME` environment variable instead.
