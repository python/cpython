This article explains the new features in Python 2.6.  No release date
for Python 2.6 has been set; it will probably be released in late 2007.

% Compare with previous release in 2 - 3 sentences here.

This article doesn't attempt to provide a complete specification of
the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview.  For
full details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 2.6.
% add hyperlink when the documentation becomes available online.
If you want to understand the complete implementation and design
rationale, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature.

pystone benchmark around XX\% faster than Python 2.5.
