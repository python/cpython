  What's New In Python 3.12
****************************

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

.. Rules for maintenance:

   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.

   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.

   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)

   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.

   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.

   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).

   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.

   * It's helpful to add the issue number as a comment:

   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer in :gh:`12345`.)

   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the VCS log when
   researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.12, compared to 3.11.

For full details, see the :ref:`changelog <changelog>`.

.. note::

   Prerelease users should be aware that this document is currently in draft
   form. It will be updated substantially as Python 3.12 moves towards release,
   so it's worth checking back even after reading earlier versions.


Summary -- Release highlights
=============================

.. This section singles out the most important changes in Python 3.12.
   Brevity is key.


.. PEP-sized items next.

Important deprecations, removals or restrictions:

* :pep:`623`, Remove wstr from Unicode

* :pep:`632`, Remove the ``distutils`` package.

Improved Error Messages
=======================

* Modules from the standard library are now potentially suggested as part of
  the error messages displayed by the interpreter when a :exc:`NameError` is
  raised to the top level. Contributed by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`98254`.

    >>> sys.version_info
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    NameError: name 'sys' is not defined. Did you forget to import 'sys'?

* Improve the error suggestion for :exc:`NameError` exceptions for instances.
  Now if a :exc:`NameError` is raised in a method and the instance has an
  attribute that's exactly equal to the name in the exception, the suggestion
  will include ``self.<NAME>`` instead of the closest match in the method
  scope. Contributed by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`99139`.

    >>> class A:
    ...    def __init__(self):
    ...        self.blech = 1
    ...
    ...    def foo(self):
    ...        somethin = blech

    >>> A().foo()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        somethin = blech
                   ^^^^^
    NameError: name 'blech' is not defined. Did you mean: 'self.blech'?


* Improve the :exc:`SyntaxError` error message when the user types ``import x
  from y`` instead of ``from y import x``. Contributed by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`98931`.

    >>> import a.y.z from b.y.z
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        import a.y.z from b.y.z
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    SyntaxError: Did you mean to use 'from ... import ...' instead?

* :exc:`ImportError` exceptions raised from failed ``from <module> import
  <name>`` statements now include suggestions for the value of ``<name>`` based on the
  available names in ``<module>``. Contributed by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`91058`.

    >>> from collections import chainmap
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: cannot import name 'chainmap' from 'collections'. Did you mean: 'ChainMap'?


New Features
============

* Add :ref:`perf_profiling` through the new
  environment variable :envvar:`PYTHONPERFSUPPORT`,
  the new command-line option :option:`-X perf <-X>`,
  as well as the new :func:`sys.activate_stack_trampoline`,
  :func:`sys.deactivate_stack_trampoline`,
  and :func:`sys.is_stack_trampoline_active` APIs.
  (Design by Pablo Galindo. Contributed by Pablo Galindo and Christian Heimes
  with contributions from Gregory P. Smith [Google] and Mark Shannon
  in :gh:`96123`.)


Other Language Changes
======================

* :class:`types.MappingProxyType` instances are now hashable if the underlying
  mapping is hashable.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`87995`.)

* :class:`memoryview` now supports the half-float type (the "e" format code).
  (Contributed by Dong-hee Na and Antoine Pitrou in :gh:`90751`.)

* The parser now raises :exc:`SyntaxError` when parsing source code containing
  null bytes. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`96670`.)

* :func:`ast.parse` now raises :exc:`SyntaxError` instead of :exc:`ValueError`
  when parsing source code containing null bytes. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo
  in :gh:`96670`.)

* The Garbage Collector now runs only on the eval breaker mechanism of the
  Python bytecode evaluation loop instead of object allocations. The GC can
  also run when :c:func:`PyErr_CheckSignals` is called so C extensions that
  need to run for a long time without executing any Python code also have a
  chance to execute the GC periodically. (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in
  :gh:`97922`.)

* A backslash-character pair that is not a valid escape sequence now generates
  a :exc:`SyntaxWarning`, instead of :exc:`DeprecationWarning`.
  For example, ``re.compile("\d+\.\d+")`` now emits a :exc:`SyntaxWarning`
  (``"\d"`` is an invalid escape sequence), use raw strings for regular
  expression: ``re.compile(r"\d+\.\d+")``.
  In a future Python version, :exc:`SyntaxError` will eventually be raised,
  instead of :exc:`SyntaxWarning`.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`98401`.)

* Octal escapes with value larger than ``0o377`` (ex: ``"\477"``), deprecated
  in Python 3.11, now produce a :exc:`SyntaxWarning`, instead of
  :exc:`DeprecationWarning`.
  In a future Python version they will be eventually a :exc:`SyntaxError`.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`98401`.)

* All builtin and extension callables expecting boolean parameters now accept
  arguments of any type instead of just :class:`bool` and :class:`int`.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`60203`.)

* Variables used in the target part of comprehensions that are not stored to
  can now be used in assignment expressions (``:=``).
  For example, in ``[(b := 1) for a, b.prop in some_iter]``, the assignment to
  ``b`` is now allowed. Note that assigning to variables stored to in the target
  part of comprehensions (like ``a``) is still disallowed, as per :pep:`572`.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`100581`.)

* :class:`slice` objects are now hashable, allowing them to be used as dict keys and
  set items. (Contributed by Will Bradshaw and Furkan Onder in :gh:`101264`.)

New Modules
===========

* None yet.


Improved Modules
================

array
-----

* The :class:`array.array` class now supports subscripting, making it a
  :term:`generic type`. (Contributed by Jelle Zijlstra in :gh:`98658`.)

asyncio
-------

* On Linux, :mod:`asyncio` uses :class:`~asyncio.PidfdChildWatcher` by default
  if :func:`os.pidfd_open` is available and functional instead of
  :class:`~asyncio.ThreadedChildWatcher`.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`98024`.)

* The child watcher classes :class:`~asyncio.MultiLoopChildWatcher`,
  :class:`~asyncio.FastChildWatcher`, :class:`~asyncio.AbstractChildWatcher`
  and :class:`~asyncio.SafeChildWatcher` are deprecated and
  will be removed in Python 3.14. It is recommended to not manually
  configure a child watcher as the event loop now uses the best available
  child watcher for each platform (:class:`~asyncio.PidfdChildWatcher`
  if supported and :class:`~asyncio.ThreadedChildWatcher` otherwise).
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`94597`.)

* :func:`asyncio.set_child_watcher`, :func:`asyncio.get_child_watcher`,
  :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy.set_child_watcher` and
  :meth:`asyncio.AbstractEventLoopPolicy.get_child_watcher` are deprecated
  and will be removed in Python 3.14.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`94597`.)

* Add *loop_factory* parameter to :func:`asyncio.run` to allow specifying
  a custom event loop factory.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`99388`.)

* Add C implementation of :func:`asyncio.current_task` for 4x-6x speedup.
  (Contributed by Itamar Ostricher and Pranav Thulasiram Bhat in :gh:`100344`.)

* :func:`asyncio.iscoroutine` now returns ``False`` for generators as
  :mod:`asyncio` does not support legacy generator-based coroutines.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`102748`.)

* :func:`asyncio.wait` now accepts generators yielding tasks.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`78530`.)

inspect
-------

* Add :func:`inspect.markcoroutinefunction` to mark sync functions that return
  a :term:`coroutine` for use with :func:`inspect.iscoroutinefunction`.
  (Contributed Carlton Gibson in :gh:`99247`.)

* Add :func:`inspect.getasyncgenstate` and :func:`inspect.getasyncgenlocals`
  for determining the current state of asynchronous generators.
  (Contributed by Thomas Krennwallner in :issue:`35759`.)

pathlib
-------

* Add :meth:`~pathlib.Path.walk` for walking the directory trees and generating
  all file or directory names within them, similar to :func:`os.walk`.
  (Contributed by Stanislav Zmiev in :gh:`90385`.)

* Add *walk_up* optional parameter to :meth:`pathlib.PurePath.relative_to`
  to allow the insertion of ``..`` entries in the result; this behavior is
  more consistent with :func:`os.path.relpath`.
  (Contributed by Domenico Ragusa in :issue:`40358`.)

* Add :meth:`pathlib.Path.is_junction` as a proxy to :func:`os.path.isjunction`.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in :gh:`99547`.)


dis
---

* Pseudo instruction opcodes (which are used by the compiler but
  do not appear in executable bytecode) are now exposed in the
  :mod:`dis` module.
  :opcode:`HAVE_ARGUMENT` is still relevant to real opcodes,
  but it is not useful for pseudo instructions. Use the new
  :data:`~dis.hasarg` collection instead.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`94216`.)

fractions
---------

* Objects of type :class:`fractions.Fraction` now support float-style
  formatting. (Contributed by Mark Dickinson in :gh:`100161`.)

math
----

* Added :func:`math.sumprod` for computing a sum of products.
  (Contributed by Raymond Hettinger in :gh:`100485`.)

os
--

* Add :data:`os.PIDFD_NONBLOCK` to open a file descriptor
  for a process with :func:`os.pidfd_open` in non-blocking mode.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`93312`.)

* :class:`os.DirEntry` now includes an :meth:`os.DirEntry.is_junction`
  method to check if the entry is a junction.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in :gh:`99547`.)

* Add :func:`os.listdrives`, :func:`os.listvolumes` and :func:`os.listmounts`
  functions on Windows for enumerating drives, volumes and mount points.
  (Contributed by Steve Dower in :gh:`102519`.)

* :func:`os.stat` and :func:`os.lstat` are now more accurate on Windows.
  The ``st_birthtime`` field will now be filled with the creation time
  of the file, and ``st_ctime`` is deprecated but still contains the
  creation time (but in the future will return the last metadata change,
  for consistency with other platforms). ``st_dev`` may be up to 64 bits
  and ``st_ino`` up to 128 bits depending on your file system, and
  ``st_rdev`` is always set to zero rather than incorrect values.
  Both functions may be significantly faster on newer releases of
  Windows. (Contributed by Steve Dower in :gh:`99726`.)

os.path
-------

* Add :func:`os.path.isjunction` to check if a given path is a junction.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in :gh:`99547`.)

* Add :func:`os.path.splitroot` to split a path into a triad
  ``(drive, root, tail)``. (Contributed by Barney Gale in :gh:`101000`.)

shutil
------

* :func:`shutil.make_archive` now passes the *root_dir* argument to custom
  archivers which support it.
  In this case it no longer temporarily changes the current working directory
  of the process to *root_dir* to perform archiving.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`74696`.)

* :func:`shutil.rmtree` now accepts a new argument *onexc* which is an
  error handler like *onerror* but which expects an exception instance
  rather than a *(typ, val, tb)* triplet. *onerror* is deprecated and
  will be removed in Python 3.14.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102828`.)

* :func:`shutil.which` now consults the *PATHEXT* environment variable to
  find matches within *PATH* on Windows even when the given *cmd* includes
  a directory component.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in :gh:`103179`.)

  :func:`shutil.which` will call ``NeedCurrentDirectoryForExePathW`` when
  querying for executables on Windows to determine if the current working
  directory should be prepended to the search path.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in :gh:`103179`.)

  :func:`shutil.which` will return a path matching the *cmd* with a component
  from ``PATHEXT`` prior to a direct match elsewhere in the search path on
  Windows.
  (Contributed by Charles Machalow in :gh:`103179`.)

sqlite3
-------

* Add a :ref:`command-line interface <sqlite3-cli>`.
  (Contributed by Erlend E. Aasland in :gh:`77617`.)

* Add the :attr:`~sqlite3.Connection.autocommit` attribute
  to :class:`~sqlite3.Connection`
  and the *autocommit* parameter to :func:`~sqlite3.connect`
  to control :pep:`249`-compliant
  :ref:`transaction handling <sqlite3-transaction-control-autocommit>`.
  (Contributed by Erlend E. Aasland in :gh:`83638`.)

threading
---------

* Add :func:`threading.settrace_all_threads` and
  :func:`threading.setprofile_all_threads` that allow to set tracing and
  profiling functions in all running threads in addition to the calling one.
  (Contributed by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`93503`.)

unicodedata
-----------

* The Unicode database has been updated to version 15.0.0. (Contributed by
  Benjamin Peterson in :gh:`96734`).

unittest
--------

Added ``--durations`` command line option, showing the N slowest test cases::

  python3 -m unittest --durations=3 lib.tests.test_threading
  .....
  Slowest test durations
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.210s     test_timeout (Lib.test.test_threading.BarrierTests)
  1.003s     test_default_timeout (Lib.test.test_threading.BarrierTests)
  0.518s     test_timeout (Lib.test.test_threading.EventTests)

  (0.000 durations hidden.  Use -v to show these durations.)
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ran 158 tests in 9.869s

  OK (skipped=3)

(Contributed by Giampaolo Rodola in :issue:`4080`)

uuid
----

* Add a :ref:`command-line interface <uuid-cli>`.
  (Contributed by Adam Chhina in :gh:`88597`.)

tempfile
--------

The :class:`tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` function has a new optional parameter
*delete_on_close* (Contributed by Evgeny Zorin in :gh:`58451`.)

typing
------

* Add :func:`typing.override`, an override decorator telling to static type
  checkers to verify that a method overrides some method or attribute of the
  same name on a base class, as per :pep:`698`. (Contributed by Steven Troxler in
  :gh:`101564`.)

* :func:`isinstance` checks against
  :func:`runtime-checkable protocols <typing.runtime_checkable>` now use
  :func:`inspect.getattr_static` rather than :func:`hasattr` to lookup whether
  attributes exist. This means that descriptors and :meth:`~object.__getattr__`
  methods are no longer unexpectedly evaluated during ``isinstance()`` checks
  against runtime-checkable protocols. However, it may also mean that some
  objects which used to be considered instances of a runtime-checkable protocol
  may no longer be considered instances of that protocol on Python 3.12+, and
  vice versa. Most users are unlikely to be affected by this change.
  (Contributed by Alex Waygood in :gh:`102433`.)

sys
---

* Add :func:`sys.activate_stack_trampoline` and
  :func:`sys.deactivate_stack_trampoline` for activating and deactivating
  stack profiler trampolines,
  and :func:`sys.is_stack_trampoline_active` for querying if stack profiler
  trampolines are active.
  (Contributed by Pablo Galindo and Christian Heimes
  with contributions from Gregory P. Smith [Google] and Mark Shannon
  in :gh:`96123`.)

* Add :data:`sys.last_exc` which holds the last unhandled exception that
  was raised (for post-mortem debugging use cases). Deprecate the
  three fields that have the same information in its legacy form:
  :data:`sys.last_type`, :data:`sys.last_value` and :data:`sys.last_traceback`.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102778`.)


Optimizations
=============

* Removed ``wstr`` and ``wstr_length`` members from Unicode objects.
  It reduces object size by 8 or 16 bytes on 64bit platform. (:pep:`623`)
  (Contributed by Inada Naoki in :gh:`92536`.)

* Added experimental support for using the BOLT binary optimizer in the build
  process, which improves performance by 1-5%.
  (Contributed by Kevin Modzelewski in :gh:`90536` and tuned by Dong-hee Na in :gh:`101525`)

* Speed up the regular expression substitution (functions :func:`re.sub` and
  :func:`re.subn` and corresponding :class:`!re.Pattern` methods) for
  replacement strings containing group references by 2--3 times.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`91524`.)


CPython bytecode changes
========================

* Removed the :opcode:`LOAD_METHOD` instruction. It has been merged into
  :opcode:`LOAD_ATTR`. :opcode:`LOAD_ATTR` will now behave like the old
  :opcode:`LOAD_METHOD` instruction if the low bit of its oparg is set.
  (Contributed by Ken Jin in :gh:`93429`.)

* Removed the :opcode:`!JUMP_IF_FALSE_OR_POP` and :opcode:`!JUMP_IF_TRUE_OR_POP`
  instructions. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102859`.)


Demos and Tools
===============

* Remove the ``Tools/demo/`` directory which contained old demo scripts. A copy
  can be found in the `old-demos project
  <https://github.com/gvanrossum/old-demos>`_.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`97681`.)

* Remove outdated example scripts of the ``Tools/scripts/`` directory.
  A copy can be found in the `old-demos project
  <https://github.com/gvanrossum/old-demos>`_.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`97669`.)


Deprecated
==========

* :class:`typing.Hashable` and :class:`typing.Sized` aliases for :class:`collections.abc.Hashable`
  and :class:`collections.abc.Sized`. (:gh:`94309`.)

* The :mod:`sqlite3` :ref:`default adapters and converters
  <sqlite3-default-converters>` are now deprecated.
  Instead, use the :ref:`sqlite3-adapter-converter-recipes`
  and tailor them to your needs.
  (Contributed by Erlend E. Aasland in :gh:`90016`.)

* In :meth:`~sqlite3.Cursor.execute`, :exc:`DeprecationWarning` is now emitted
  when :ref:`named placeholders <sqlite3-placeholders>` are used together with
  parameters supplied as a :term:`sequence` instead of as a :class:`dict`.
  Starting from Python 3.14, using named placeholders with parameters supplied
  as a sequence will raise a :exc:`~sqlite3.ProgrammingError`.
  (Contributed by Erlend E. Aasland in :gh:`101698`.)

* The 3-arg signatures (type, value, traceback) of :meth:`~coroutine.throw`,
  :meth:`~generator.throw` and :meth:`~agen.athrow` are deprecated and
  may be removed in a future version of Python. Use the single-arg versions
  of these functions instead. (Contributed by Ofey Chan in :gh:`89874`.)

* :exc:`DeprecationWarning` is now raised when ``__package__`` on a
  module differs from ``__spec__.parent`` (previously it was
  :exc:`ImportWarning`).
  (Contributed by Brett Cannon in :gh:`65961`.)

* The :meth:`~asyncio.get_event_loop` method of the
  default event loop policy now emits a :exc:`DeprecationWarning` if there
  is no current event loop set and it decides to create one.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka and Guido van Rossum in :gh:`100160`.)

* The :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree` module now emits :exc:`DeprecationWarning`
  when testing the truth value of an :class:`xml.etree.ElementTree.Element`.
  Before, the Python implementation emitted :exc:`FutureWarning`, and the C
  implementation emitted nothing.

* In accordance with :pep:`699`, the ``ma_version_tag`` field in :c:type:`PyDictObject`
  is deprecated for extension modules. Accessing this field will generate a compiler
  warning at compile time. This field will be removed in Python 3.14.
  (Contributed by Ramvikrams and Kumar Aditya in :gh:`101193`. PEP by Ken Jin.)

* The ``st_ctime`` fields return by :func:`os.stat` and :func:`os.lstat` on
  Windows are deprecated. In a future release, they will contain the last
  metadata change time, consistent with other platforms. For now, they still
  contain the creation time, which is also available in the new ``st_birthtime``
  field. (Contributed by Steve Dower in :gh:`99726`.)

* The :data:`sys.last_type`, :data:`sys.last_value` and :data:`sys.last_traceback`
  fields are deprecated. Use :data:`sys.last_exc` instead.
  (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102778`.)

* The *onerror* argument of :func:`shutil.rmtree` is deprecated as will be removed
  in Python 3.14. Use *onexc* instead. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102828`.)


Pending Removal in Python 3.13
------------------------------

The following modules and APIs have been deprecated in earlier Python releases,
and will be removed in Python 3.13.

Modules (see :pep:`594`):

* :mod:`aifc`
* :mod:`audioop`
* :mod:`cgi`
* :mod:`cgitb`
* :mod:`chunk`
* :mod:`crypt`
* :mod:`imghdr`
* :mod:`mailcap`
* :mod:`msilib`
* :mod:`nis`
* :mod:`nntplib`
* :mod:`ossaudiodev`
* :mod:`pipes`
* :mod:`sndhdr`
* :mod:`spwd`
* :mod:`sunau`
* :mod:`telnetlib`
* :mod:`uu`
* :mod:`xdrlib`

APIs:

* :class:`!configparser.LegacyInterpolation` (:gh:`90765`)
* :func:`locale.getdefaultlocale` (:gh:`90817`)
* :meth:`!turtle.RawTurtle.settiltangle` (:gh:`50096`)
* :func:`!unittest.findTestCases` (:gh:`50096`)
* :func:`!unittest.makeSuite` (:gh:`50096`)
* :func:`!unittest.getTestCaseNames` (:gh:`50096`)
* :class:`!webbrowser.MacOSX` (:gh:`86421`)

Pending Removal in Python 3.14
------------------------------

* Deprecated the following :mod:`importlib.abc` classes, scheduled for removal in
  Python 3.14:

  * :class:`!importlib.abc.ResourceReader`
  * :class:`!importlib.abc.Traversable`
  * :class:`!importlib.abc.TraversableResources`

  Use :mod:`importlib.resources.abc` classes instead:

  * :class:`importlib.resources.abc.Traversable`
  * :class:`importlib.resources.abc.TraversableResources`

  (Contributed by Jason R. Coombs and Hugo van Kemenade in :gh:`93963`.)

* Creating immutable types (:data:`Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE`) with mutable
  bases using the C API.

* Deprecated the *isdst* parameter in :func:`email.utils.localtime`.
  (Contributed by Alan Williams in :gh:`72346`.)

* ``__package__`` and ``__cached__`` will cease to be set or taken
  into consideration by the import system (:gh:`97879`).

* Testing the truth value of an :class:`xml.etree.ElementTree.Element`
  is deprecated and will raise an exception in Python 3.14.

* The default :mod:`multiprocessing` start method will change to a safer one on
  Linux, BSDs, and other non-macOS POSIX platforms where ``'fork'`` is currently
  the default (:gh:`84559`). Adding a runtime warning about this was deemed too
  disruptive as the majority of code is not expected to care. Use the
  :func:`~multiprocessing.get_context` or
  :func:`~multiprocessing.set_start_method` APIs to explicitly specify when
  your code *requires* ``'fork'``.  See :ref:`multiprocessing-start-methods`.

* :mod:`pty` has two undocumented ``master_open()`` and ``slave_open()``
  functions that have been deprecated since Python 2 but only gained a
  proper :exc:`DeprecationWarning` in 3.12. Remove them in 3.14.

* Accessing ``co_lnotab`` was deprecated in :pep:`626` since 3.10
  and was planned to be removed in 3.12
  but it only got a proper :exc:`DeprecationWarning` in 3.12.
  May be removed in 3.14.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`101866`.)

* The *onerror* argument of :func:`shutil.rmtree` is deprecated in 3.12,
  and will be removed in 3.14.

Pending Removal in Future Versions
----------------------------------

The following APIs were deprecated in earlier Python versions and will be removed,
although there is currently no date scheduled for their removal.

* :class:`typing.Text` (:gh:`92332`)

* Currently Python accepts numeric literals immediately followed by keywords,
  for example ``0in x``, ``1or x``, ``0if 1else 2``.  It allows confusing
  and ambiguous expressions like ``[0x1for x in y]`` (which can be
  interpreted as ``[0x1 for x in y]`` or ``[0x1f or x in y]``).
  A syntax warning is raised if the numeric literal is
  immediately followed by one of keywords :keyword:`and`, :keyword:`else`,
  :keyword:`for`, :keyword:`if`, :keyword:`in`, :keyword:`is` and :keyword:`or`.
  In a future release it will be changed to a syntax error. (:gh:`87999`)


Removed
=======

* Remove the ``distutils`` package. It was deprecated in Python 3.10 by
  :pep:`632` "Deprecate distutils module". For projects still using
  ``distutils`` and cannot be updated to something else, the ``setuptools``
  project can be installed: it still provides ``distutils``.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`92584`.)

* Removed many old deprecated :mod:`unittest` features:

  - A number of :class:`~unittest.TestCase` method aliases:

    You can use https://github.com/isidentical/teyit to automatically modernise
    your unit tests.

  - Undocumented and broken :class:`~unittest.TestCase` method
    ``assertDictContainsSubset`` (deprecated in Python 3.2).

  - Undocumented :meth:`TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule
    <unittest.TestLoader.loadTestsFromModule>` parameter *use_load_tests*
    (deprecated and ignored since Python 3.2).

  - An alias of the :class:`~unittest.TextTestResult` class:
    ``_TextTestResult`` (deprecated in Python 3.2).

  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :issue:`45162`.)

* Several names deprecated in the :mod:`configparser` way back in 3.2 have
  been removed per :gh:`89336`:

  * :class:`configparser.ParsingError` no longer has a ``filename`` attribute
    or argument. Use the ``source`` attribute and argument instead.
  * :mod:`configparser` no longer has a ``SafeConfigParser`` class. Use the
    shorter :class:`~configparser.ConfigParser` name instead.
  * :class:`configparser.ConfigParser` no longer has a ``readfp`` method.
    Use :meth:`~configparser.ConfigParser.read_file` instead.

* The following undocumented :mod:`sqlite3` features, deprecated in Python
  3.10, are now removed:

  * ``sqlite3.enable_shared_cache()``
  * ``sqlite3.OptimizedUnicode``

  If a shared cache must be used, open the database in URI mode using the
  ``cache=shared`` query parameter.

  The ``sqlite3.OptimizedUnicode`` text factory has been an alias for
  :class:`str` since Python 3.3. Code that previously set the text factory to
  ``OptimizedUnicode`` can either use ``str`` explicitly, or rely on the
  default value which is also ``str``.

  (Contributed by Erlend E. Aasland in :gh:`92548`.)

* ``smtpd`` has been removed according to the schedule in :pep:`594`,
  having been deprecated in Python 3.4.7 and 3.5.4.
  Use aiosmtpd_ PyPI module or any other
  :mod:`asyncio`-based server instead.
  (Contributed by Oleg Iarygin in :gh:`93243`.)

.. _aiosmtpd: https://pypi.org/project/aiosmtpd/

* ``asynchat`` and ``asyncore`` have been removed
  according to the schedule in :pep:`594`,
  having been deprecated in Python 3.6.
  Use :mod:`asyncio` instead.
  (Contributed by Nikita Sobolev in :gh:`96580`.)

* Remove ``io.OpenWrapper`` and ``_pyio.OpenWrapper``, deprecated in Python
  3.10: just use :func:`open` instead. The :func:`open` (:func:`io.open`)
  function is a built-in function. Since Python 3.10, :func:`!_pyio.open` is
  also a static method.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94169`.)

* Remove the :func:`!ssl.RAND_pseudo_bytes` function, deprecated in Python 3.6:
  use :func:`os.urandom` or :func:`ssl.RAND_bytes` instead.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94199`.)

* :mod:`gzip`: Remove the ``filename`` attribute of :class:`gzip.GzipFile`,
  deprecated since Python 2.6, use the :attr:`~gzip.GzipFile.name` attribute
  instead. In write mode, the ``filename`` attribute added ``'.gz'`` file
  extension if it was not present.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94196`.)

* Remove the :func:`!ssl.match_hostname` function.
  It was deprecated in Python 3.7. OpenSSL performs
  hostname matching since Python 3.7, Python no longer uses the
  :func:`!ssl.match_hostname` function.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94199`.)

* Remove the :func:`!locale.format` function, deprecated in Python 3.7:
  use :func:`locale.format_string` instead.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94226`.)

* :mod:`hashlib`: Remove the pure Python implementation of
  :func:`hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac()`, deprecated in Python 3.10. Python 3.10 and
  newer requires OpenSSL 1.1.1 (:pep:`644`): this OpenSSL version provides
  a C implementation of :func:`~hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac()` which is faster.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94199`.)

* :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree`: Remove the ``ElementTree.Element.copy()`` method of the
  pure Python implementation, deprecated in Python 3.10, use the
  :func:`copy.copy` function instead.  The C implementation of :mod:`xml.etree.ElementTree`
  has no ``copy()`` method, only a ``__copy__()`` method.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94383`.)

* :mod:`zipimport`: Remove ``find_loader()`` and ``find_module()`` methods,
  deprecated in Python 3.10: use the ``find_spec()`` method instead.  See
  :pep:`451` for the rationale.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94379`.)

* Remove the :func:`!ssl.wrap_socket` function, deprecated in Python 3.7:
  instead, create a :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object and call its
  :class:`ssl.SSLContext.wrap_socket` method. Any package that still uses
  :func:`!ssl.wrap_socket` is broken and insecure. The function neither sends a
  SNI TLS extension nor validates server hostname. Code is subject to `CWE-295
  <https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html>`_: Improper Certificate
  Validation.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94199`.)

* Many previously deprecated cleanups in :mod:`importlib` have now been
  completed:

  * References to, and support for ``module_repr()`` has been eradicated.


* ``importlib.util.set_package`` has been removed.
  (Contributed by Brett Cannon in :gh:`65961`.)

* Removed the ``suspicious`` rule from the documentation Makefile, and
  removed ``Doc/tools/rstlint.py``, both in favor of `sphinx-lint
  <https://github.com/sphinx-contrib/sphinx-lint>`_.
  (Contributed by Julien Palard in :gh:`98179`.)

* Remove the *keyfile* and *certfile* parameters from the
  :mod:`ftplib`, :mod:`imaplib`, :mod:`poplib` and :mod:`smtplib` modules,
  and the *key_file*, *cert_file* and *check_hostname* parameters from the
  :mod:`http.client` module,
  all deprecated since Python 3.6. Use the *context* parameter
  (*ssl_context* in :mod:`imaplib`) instead.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94172`.)

* :mod:`ftplib`: Remove the ``FTP_TLS.ssl_version`` class attribute: use the
  *context* parameter instead.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94172`.)

* Remove support for obsolete browsers from :mod:`webbrowser`.
  Removed browsers include: Grail, Mosaic, Netscape, Galeon, Skipstone,
  Iceape, Firebird, and Firefox versions 35 and below (:gh:`102871`).


Porting to Python 3.12
======================

This section lists previously described changes and other bugfixes
that may require changes to your code.

Changes in the Python API
-------------------------

* More strict rules are now applied for numerical group references and
  group names in regular expressions.
  Only sequence of ASCII digits is now accepted as a numerical reference.
  The group name in bytes patterns and replacement strings can now only
  contain ASCII letters and digits and underscore.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`91760`.)

* Removed ``randrange()`` functionality deprecated since Python 3.10.  Formerly,
  ``randrange(10.0)`` losslessly converted to ``randrange(10)``. Now, it raises a
  :exc:`TypeError`. Also, the exception raised for non-integral values such as
  ``randrange(10.5)`` or ``randrange('10')`` has been changed from :exc:`ValueError` to
  :exc:`TypeError`.  This also prevents bugs where ``randrange(1e25)`` would silently
  select from a larger range than ``randrange(10**25)``.
  (Originally suggested by Serhiy Storchaka :gh:`86388`.)

* :class:`argparse.ArgumentParser` changed encoding and error handler
  for reading arguments from file (e.g. ``fromfile_prefix_chars`` option)
  from default text encoding (e.g. :func:`locale.getpreferredencoding(False) <locale.getpreferredencoding>`)
  to :term:`filesystem encoding and error handler`.
  Argument files should be encoded in UTF-8 instead of ANSI Codepage on Windows.

* Removed the ``asyncore``-based ``smtpd`` module deprecated in Python 3.4.7
  and 3.5.4.  A recommended replacement is the
  :mod:`asyncio`-based aiosmtpd_ PyPI module.

* :func:`shlex.split`: Passing ``None`` for *s* argument now raises an
  exception, rather than reading :data:`sys.stdin`. The feature was deprecated
  in Python 3.9.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`94352`.)

* The :mod:`os` module no longer accepts bytes-like paths, like
  :class:`bytearray` and :class:`memoryview` types: only the exact
  :class:`bytes` type is accepted for bytes strings.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`98393`.)

* :func:`syslog.openlog` and :func:`syslog.closelog` now fail if used in subinterpreters.
  :func:`syslog.syslog` may still be used in subinterpreters,
  but now only if :func:`syslog.openlog` has already been called in the main interpreter.
  These new restrictions do not apply to the main interpreter,
  so only a very small set of users might be affected.
  This change helps with interpreter isolation.  Furthermore, :mod:`syslog` is a wrapper
  around process-global resources, which are best managed from the main interpreter.
  (Contributed by Dong-hee Na in :gh:`99127`.)

* The undocumented locking behavior of :func:`~functools.cached_property`
  is removed, because it locked across all instances of the class, leading to high
  lock contention. This means that a cached property getter function could now run
  more than once for a single instance, if two threads race. For most simple
  cached properties (e.g. those that are idempotent and simply calculate a value
  based on other attributes of the instance) this will be fine.  If
  synchronization is needed, implement locking within the cached property getter
  function or around multi-threaded access points.


Build Changes
=============

* Python no longer uses ``setup.py`` to build shared C extension modules.
  Build parameters like headers and libraries are detected in ``configure``
  script. Extensions are built by ``Makefile``. Most extensions use
  ``pkg-config`` and fall back to manual detection.
  (Contributed by Christian Heimes in :gh:`93939`.)

* ``va_start()`` with two parameters, like ``va_start(args, format),``
  is now required to build Python.
  ``va_start()`` is no longer called with a single parameter.
  (Contributed by Kumar Aditya in :gh:`93207`.)

* CPython now uses the ThinLTO option as the default link time optimization policy
  if the Clang compiler accepts the flag.
  (Contributed by Dong-hee Na in :gh:`89536`.)

* Add ``COMPILEALL_OPTS`` variable in Makefile to override :mod:`compileall`
  options (default: ``-j0``) in ``make install``. Also merged the 3
  ``compileall`` commands into a single command to build .pyc files for all
  optimization levels (0, 1, 2) at once.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`99289`.)


C API Changes
=============

New Features
------------


* :pep:`697`: Introduced the :ref:`Unstable C API tier <unstable-c-api>`,
  intended for low-level tools like debuggers and JIT compilers.
  This API may change in each minor release of CPython without deprecation
  warnings.
  Its contents are marked by the ``PyUnstable_`` prefix in names.

  Code object constructors:

  - ``PyUnstable_Code_New()`` (renamed from ``PyCode_New``)
  - ``PyUnstable_Code_NewWithPosOnlyArgs()`` (renamed from ``PyCode_NewWithPosOnlyArgs``)

  Extra storage for code objects (:pep:`523`):

  - ``PyUnstable_Eval_RequestCodeExtraIndex()`` (renamed from ``_PyEval_RequestCodeExtraIndex``)
  - ``PyUnstable_Code_GetExtra()`` (renamed from ``_PyCode_GetExtra``)
  - ``PyUnstable_Code_SetExtra()`` (renamed from ``_PyCode_SetExtra``)

  The original names will continue to be available until the respective
  API changes.

  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`101101`.)

* Added the new limited C API function :c:func:`PyType_FromMetaclass`,
  which generalizes the existing :c:func:`PyType_FromModuleAndSpec` using
  an additional metaclass argument.
  (Contributed by Wenzel Jakob in :gh:`93012`.)

* API for creating objects that can be called using
  :ref:`the vectorcall protocol <vectorcall>` was added to the
  :ref:`Limited API <stable>`:

  * :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL`
  * :c:func:`PyVectorcall_NARGS`
  * :c:func:`PyVectorcall_Call`
  * :c:type:`vectorcallfunc`

  The :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL` flag is now removed from a class
  when the class's :py:meth:`~object.__call__` method is reassigned.
  This makes vectorcall safe to use with mutable types (i.e. heap types
  without the immutable flag, :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE`).
  Mutable types that do not override :c:member:`~PyTypeObject.tp_call` now
  inherit the ``Py_TPFLAGS_HAVE_VECTORCALL`` flag.
  (Contributed by Petr Viktorin in :gh:`93274`.)

  The :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT` and :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_WEAKREF`
  flags have been added. This allows extensions classes to support object
  ``__dict__`` and weakrefs with less bookkeeping,
  using less memory and with faster access.

* API for performing calls using
  :ref:`the vectorcall protocol <vectorcall>` was added to the
  :ref:`Limited API <stable>`:

  * :c:func:`PyObject_Vectorcall`
  * :c:func:`PyObject_VectorcallMethod`
  * :const:`PY_VECTORCALL_ARGUMENTS_OFFSET`

  This means that both the incoming and outgoing ends of the vector call
  protocol are now available in the :ref:`Limited API <stable>`. (Contributed
  by Wenzel Jakob in :gh:`98586`.)

* Added two new public functions,
  :c:func:`PyEval_SetProfileAllThreads` and
  :c:func:`PyEval_SetTraceAllThreads`, that allow to set tracing and profiling
  functions in all running threads in addition to the calling one. (Contributed
  by Pablo Galindo in :gh:`93503`.)

* Added new function :c:func:`PyFunction_SetVectorcall` to the C API
  which sets the vectorcall field of a given :c:type:`PyFunctionObject`.
  (Contributed by Andrew Frost in :gh:`92257`.)

* The C API now permits registering callbacks via :c:func:`PyDict_AddWatcher`,
  :c:func:`PyDict_Watch` and related APIs to be called whenever a dictionary
  is modified. This is intended for use by optimizing interpreters, JIT
  compilers, or debuggers.
  (Contributed by Carl Meyer in :gh:`91052`.)

* Added :c:func:`PyType_AddWatcher` and :c:func:`PyType_Watch` API to register
  callbacks to receive notification on changes to a type.
  (Contributed by Carl Meyer in :gh:`91051`.)

* Added :c:func:`PyCode_AddWatcher` and :c:func:`PyCode_ClearWatcher`
  APIs to register callbacks to receive notification on creation and
  destruction of code objects.
  (Contributed by Itamar Ostricher in :gh:`91054`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyFrame_GetVar` and :c:func:`PyFrame_GetVarString` functions to
  get a frame variable by its name.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`91248`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyErr_GetRaisedException` and :c:func:`PyErr_SetRaisedException`
  for saving and restoring the current exception.
  These functions return and accept a single exception object,
  rather than the triple arguments of the now-deprecated
  :c:func:`PyErr_Fetch` and :c:func:`PyErr_Restore`.
  This is less error prone and a bit more efficient.
  (Contributed by Mark Shannon in :gh:`101578`.)

* Add ``_PyErr_ChainExceptions1``, which takes an exception instance,
  to replace the legacy-API ``_PyErr_ChainExceptions``, which is now
  deprecated. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in :gh:`101578`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyException_GetArgs` and :c:func:`PyException_SetArgs`
  as convenience functions for retrieving and modifying
  the :attr:`~BaseException.args` passed to the exception's constructor.
  (Contributed by Mark Shannon in :gh:`101578`.)

* Add :c:func:`PyErr_DisplayException`, which takes an exception instance,
  to replace the legacy-api :c:func:`!PyErr_Display`. (Contributed by
  Irit Katriel in :gh:`102755`).

Porting to Python 3.12
----------------------

* Legacy Unicode APIs based on ``Py_UNICODE*`` representation has been removed.
  Please migrate to APIs based on UTF-8 or ``wchar_t*``.

* Argument parsing functions like :c:func:`PyArg_ParseTuple` doesn't support
  ``Py_UNICODE*`` based format (e.g. ``u``, ``Z``) anymore. Please migrate
  to other formats for Unicode like ``s``, ``z``, ``es``, and ``U``.

* ``tp_weaklist`` for all static builtin types is always ``NULL``.
  This is an internal-only field on ``PyTypeObject``
  but we're pointing out the change in case someone happens to be
  accessing the field directly anyway.  To avoid breakage, consider
  using the existing public C-API instead, or, if necessary, the
  (internal-only) ``_PyObject_GET_WEAKREFS_LISTPTR()`` macro.

* This internal-only :c:member:`PyTypeObject.tp_subclasses` may now not be
  a valid object pointer.  Its type was changed to :c:expr:`void *` to
  reflect this.  We mention this in case someone happens to be accessing the
  internal-only field directly.

  To get a list of subclasses, call the Python method
  :py:meth:`~class.__subclasses__` (using :c:func:`PyObject_CallMethod`,
  for example).

* An unrecognized format character in :c:func:`PyUnicode_FromFormat` and
  :c:func:`PyUnicode_FromFormatV` now sets a :exc:`SystemError`.
  In previous versions it caused all the rest of the format string to be
  copied as-is to the result string, and any extra arguments discarded.
  (Contributed by Serhiy Storchaka in :gh:`95781`.)

* Fixed wrong sign placement in :c:func:`PyUnicode_FromFormat` and
  :c:func:`PyUnicode_FromFormatV`.
  (Contributed by Philip Georgi in :gh:`95504`.)

* Extension classes wanting to add a ``__dict__`` or weak reference slot
  should use :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT` and
  :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_WEAKREF` instead of ``tp_dictoffset`` and
  ``tp_weaklistoffset``, respectively.
  The use of ``tp_dictoffset`` and ``tp_weaklistoffset`` is still
  supported, but does not fully support multiple inheritance
  (:gh:`95589`), and performance may be worse.
  Classes declaring :const:`Py_TPFLAGS_MANAGED_DICT` should call
  :c:func:`!_PyObject_VisitManagedDict` and :c:func:`!_PyObject_ClearManagedDict`
  to traverse and clear their instance's dictionaries.
  To clear weakrefs, call :c:func:`PyObject_ClearWeakRefs`, as before.

* The :c:func:`PyUnicode_FSDecoder` function no longer accepts bytes-like
  paths, like :class:`bytearray` and :class:`memoryview` types: only the exact
  :class:`bytes` type is accepted for bytes strings.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`98393`.)

* The :c:macro:`Py_CLEAR`, :c:macro:`Py_SETREF` and :c:macro:`Py_XSETREF`
  macros now only evaluate their arguments once. If an argument has side
  effects, these side effects are no longer duplicated.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`98724`.)

* The interpreter's error indicator is now always normalized. This means
  that :c:func:`PyErr_SetObject`, :c:func:`PyErr_SetString` and the other
  functions that set the error indicator now normalize the exception
  before storing it. (Contributed by Mark Shannon in :gh:`101578`.)

* ``_Py_RefTotal`` is no longer authoritative and only kept around
  for ABI compabitility.  Note that it is an internal global and only
  available on debug builds.  If you happen to be using it then you'll
  need to start using ``_Py_GetGlobalRefTotal()``.

Deprecated
----------

* Deprecate global configuration variable:

  * :c:var:`Py_DebugFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.parser_debug`
  * :c:var:`Py_VerboseFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.verbose`
  * :c:var:`Py_QuietFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.quiet`
  * :c:var:`Py_InteractiveFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.interactive`
  * :c:var:`Py_InspectFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.inspect`

  * :c:var:`Py_DontWriteBytecodeFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.write_bytecode`
  * :c:var:`Py_NoUserSiteDirectory`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.user_site_directory`
  * :c:var:`Py_UnbufferedStdioFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.buffered_stdio`
  * :c:var:`Py_HashRandomizationFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.use_hash_seed`
    and :c:member:`PyConfig.hash_seed`
  * :c:var:`Py_IsolatedFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.isolated`
  * :c:var:`Py_LegacyWindowsFSEncodingFlag`: use :c:member:`PyPreConfig.legacy_windows_fs_encoding`
  * :c:var:`Py_LegacyWindowsStdioFlag`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.legacy_windows_stdio`
  * :c:var:`!Py_FileSystemDefaultEncoding`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.filesystem_encoding`
  * :c:var:`!Py_FileSystemDefaultEncodeErrors`: use :c:member:`PyConfig.filesystem_errors`
  * :c:var:`!Py_UTF8Mode`: use :c:member:`PyPreConfig.utf8_mode` (see :c:func:`Py_PreInitialize`)

  The :c:func:`Py_InitializeFromConfig` API should be used with
  :c:type:`PyConfig` instead.
  (Contributed by Victor Stinner in :gh:`77782`.)

* Creating immutable types (:const:`Py_TPFLAGS_IMMUTABLETYPE`) with mutable
  bases is deprecated and will be disabled in Python 3.14.

* The ``structmember.h`` header is deprecated, though it continues to be
  available and there are no plans to remove it.

  Its contents are now available just by including ``Python.h``,
  with a ``Py`` prefix added if it was missing:

  - :c:struct:`PyMemberDef`, :c:func:`PyMember_GetOne` and
    :c:func:`PyMember_SetOne`
  - Type macros like :c:macro:`Py_T_INT`, :c:macro:`Py_T_DOUBLE`, etc.
    (previously ``T_INT``, ``T_DOUBLE``, etc.)
  - The flags :c:macro:`Py_READONLY` (previously ``READONLY``) and
    :c:macro:`Py_AUDIT_READ` (previously all uppercase)

  Several items are not exposed from ``Python.h``:

  - :c:macro:`T_OBJECT` (use :c:macro:`Py_T_OBJECT_EX`)
  - :c:macro:`T_NONE` (previously undocumented, and pretty quirky)
  - The macro ``WRITE_RESTRICTED`` which does nothing.
  - The macros ``RESTRICTED`` and ``READ_RESTRICTED``, equivalents of
    :c:macro:`Py_AUDIT_READ`.
  - In some configurations, ``<stddef.h>`` is not included from ``Python.h``.
    It should be included manually when using ``offsetof()``.

  The deprecated header continues to provide its original
  contents under the original names.
  Your old code can stay unchanged, unless the extra include and non-namespaced
  macros bother you greatly.

  (Contributed in :gh:`47146` by Petr Viktorin, based on
  earlier work by Alexander Belopolsky and Matthias Braun.)

* :c:func:`PyErr_Fetch` and :c:func:`PyErr_Restore` are deprecated.
  Use :c:func:`PyErr_GetRaisedException` and
  :c:func:`PyErr_SetRaisedException` instead.
  (Contributed by Mark Shannon in :gh:`101578`.)

* :c:func:`!PyErr_Display` is deprecated. Use :c:func:`PyErr_DisplayException`
  instead. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102755`).

* ``_PyErr_ChainExceptions`` is deprecated. Use ``_PyErr_ChainExceptions1``
  instead. (Contributed by Irit Katriel in :gh:`102192`.)

Removed
-------

* Remove the ``token.h`` header file. There was never any public tokenizer C
  API. The ``token.h`` header file was only designed to be used by Python
