   Rules for maintenance:
   
   * Anyone can add text to this document.  Do not spend very much time
   on the wording of your changes, because your text will probably
   get rewritten to some degree.
   
   * The maintainer will go through Misc/NEWS periodically and add
   changes; it's therefore more important to add your changes to
   Misc/NEWS than to this file.
   
   * This is not a complete list of every single change; completeness
   is the purpose of Misc/NEWS.  Some changes I consider too small
   or esoteric to include.  If such a change is added to the text,
   I'll just remove it.  (This is another reason you shouldn't spend
   too much time on writing your addition.)
   
   * If you want to draw your new text to the attention of the
   maintainer, add 'XXX' to the beginning of the paragraph or
   section.
   
   * It's OK to just add a fragmentary note about a change.  For
   example: "XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the
   socket module."  The maintainer will research the change and
   write the necessary text.
   
   * You can comment out your additions if you like, but it's not
   necessary (especially when a final release is some months away).
   
   * Credit the author of a patch or bugfix.   Just the name is
   sufficient; the e-mail address isn't necessary.
   
   * It's helpful to add the bug/patch number as a comment:
   
   % Patch 12345
   XXX Describe the transmogrify() function added to the socket
   module.
   (Contributed by P.Y. Developer.)
   
   This saves the maintainer the effort of going through the SVN log
   when researching a change.

This article explains the new features in Python 3.0, compared to 2.6.
Python 3.0, also known as "Python 3000" or "Py3k", is the first ever
*intentionally incompatible* release.  There are more changes than in
a typical release, and more that are important for all Python users.
Nevertheless, after digesting the changes, you'll find that Python
really hasn't changed all that much -- by and large, we're merely
fixing well-known annoyances and warts.

This article doesn't attempt to provide a complete specification of
the new features, but instead provides a convenient overview.  For
full details, you should refer to the documentation for Python 3.0. If
you want to understand the complete implementation and design
rationale, refer to the PEP for a particular new feature.

.. Compare with previous release in 2 - 3 sentences here.
.. add hyperlink when the documentation becomes available online.

.. ======================================================================
.. Large, PEP-level features and changes should be described here.
.. Should there be a new section here for 3k migration?
.. Or perhaps a more general section describing module changes/deprecation?

Common Stumbling Blocks
=======================

This section lists those few changes that are most likely to trip you
up if you're used to Python 2.5.

Print Is A Function
-------------------

The :keyword:`print` statement has been replaced with a :func:`print`
function, with keyword arguments to replace most of the special syntax
of the old :keyword:`print` statement (:pep:`3105`).  Examples::

  Old: print "The answer is", 2*2
  New: print("The answer is", 2*2)

  Old: print x,           # Trailing comma suppresses newline
  New: print(x, end=" ")  # Appends a space instead of a newline

  Old: print              # Prints a newline
  New: print()            # You must call the function!

  Old: print >>sys.stderr, "fatal error"
  New: print("fatal error", file=sys.stderr)

  Old: print (x, y)       # prints repr((x, y))
  New: print((x, y))      # Not the same as print(x, y)!

You can also customize the separator between items, e.g.::

  print("There are <", 2**32, "> possibilities!", sep="")

which produces::

  There are <4294967296> possibilities!

Note:

* The :func:`print` function doesn't support the "softspace" feature of
  the old :keyword:`print` statement.  For example, in Python 2.x,
  ``print "A\n", "B"`` would write ``"A\nB\n"``; but in Python 3.0,
  ``print("A\n", "B")`` writes ``"A\n B\n"``.

* Initially, you'll be finding yourself typing the old ``print x``
  a lot in interactive mode.  Time to retrain your fingers to type
  ``print(x)`` instead!

* When using the ``2to3`` source-to-source conversion tool, all
  :keyword:`print` statements are automatically converted to
  :func:`print` function calls, so this is mostly a non-issue for
  larger projects.

Text Strings Vs. Bytes
----------------------

Everything you thought you knew about binary data and Unicode has
changed.  There's a longer section below; here's a summary of the
changes:

* Python 3.0 uses *strings* and *bytes* instead of *Unicode strings*
  and *8-bit strings*.  The difference is that any attempt to mix
  strings and bytes in Python 3.0 raises a TypeError exception,
  whereas if you were to mix Unicode and 8-bit strings in Python 2.x,
  you would only get an exception if the 8-bit string contained
  non-ASCII values.  As a consequence, pretty much all code that
  uses Unicode, encodings or binary data most likely has to change.
  The change is for the better, as in the 2.x world there were
  numerous bugs having to do with mixing encoded and unencoded text.

* Files opened as text files (still the default mode for :func:`open`)
  always use an encoding to map between strings (in memory) and bytes
  (on disk).  Binary files (opened with a ``b`` in the mode argument)
  always use bytes in memory.  This means that if a file is opened
  using an incorrect mode or encoding, I/O will likely fail.  There is
  a platform-dependent default encoding, which on Unixy platforms can
  be set with the ``LANG`` environment variable (and sometimes also
  with some other platform-specific locale-related environment
  variables).  In many cases, but not all, the system default is
  UTF-8; you should never count on this default.  Any application
  reading or writing more than pure ASCII text should probably have a
  way to override the encoding.

* The builtin :class:`basestring` abstract type was removed.  Use
  :class:`str` instead.  The :class:`str` and :class:`bytes` types
  don't have functionality enough in common to warrant a shared base
  class.

* See also the :ref:`unicode-howto`, which was updated for Python 3.0.

Views And Interators Instead Of Lists
-------------------------------------

Some well-known APIs no longer return lists:

* :class:`dict` methods :meth:`dict.keys`, :meth:`dict.items` and
  :meth:`dict.values` return "views" instead of lists.  For example,
  this no longer works: ``k = d.keys(); k.sort()``.  Use ``k =
  sorted(d)`` instead.

* Also, the :meth:`dict.iterkeys`, :meth:`dict.iteritems` and
  :meth:`dict.itervalues` methods are no longer supported.

* :func:`map` and :func:`filter` return iterators.  A quick fix is e.g.
  ``list(map(...))``, but a better fix is often to use a list
  comprehension (especially when the original code uses :keyword:`lambda`).
  Particularly tricky is :func:`map` invoked for the side effects of the
  function; the correct transformation is to use a for-loop.

* :func:`range` now behaves like :func:`xrange` used to behave.
  The latter no longer exists.

* :func:`zip` now returns an iterator.

* XXX More below?

Ordering Comparisons
--------------------

Python 3.0 has simplified the rules for ordering comparisons:

* The ordering comparison operators (``<``, ``<=``, ``>=``, ``>``)
  raise a TypeError exception when the operands don't have a
  meaningful natural ordering.  Thus, expressions like ``1 < ''``, ``0
  > None`` or ``len <= len`` are no longer valid.  A corollary is that
  sorting a heterogeneous list no longer makes sense -- all the
  elements must be comparable to each other.  Note that this does not
  apply to the ``==`` and ``!=`` operators: objects of different
  uncomparable types always compare unequal to each other, and an
  object always compares equal to itself (i.e., ``x is y`` implies ``x
  = y``; this is true even for ``NaN``).

* :meth:`builtin.sorted` and :meth:`list.sort` no longer accept the *cmp*
  argument providing a comparison function.  Use the *key* argument
  instead. N.B. the *key* and *reverse* arguments are now "keyword-only".

* The :func:`cmp` function is gone, and the :meth:`__cmp__` special
  method is no longer supported.  Use :meth:`__lt__` for sorting,
  :meth:`__eq__` with :meth:`__hash__`, and other rich comparisons as
  needed.  if you really need the :func:`cmp` functionality, the
  expression ``(a > b) - (a < b)`` is equivalent to ``cmp(a, b)``.

* XXX More below?

Integers
--------

* :pep:`0237`: :class:`long` renamed to :class:`int`.  That is, there
  is only one built-in integral type, named :class:`int`; but it
  behaves mostly like the old :class:`long` type.

* The :func:`repr` of a long integer doesn't include the trailing ``L``
  anymore, so code that unconditionally strips that character will
  chop off the last digit instead.  (Use :func:`str` instead.)

* The :data:`sys.maxint` constant was removed, since there is no
  longer a limit to the value of ints.  However, :data:`sys.maxsize`
  can be used as an integer larger than any practical list or string
  index.  It conforms to the implementation's "natural" integer size
  and is typically the same as :data:`sys.maxint` in previous releases
  on the same platform (assuming the same build options).

* ``1/2`` returns a float.  Use ``1//2`` to get the truncating behavior.
  (The latter syntax has existed for years, at least since Python 2.2.)
  See :pep:`0238`.


Overview Of Syntactic Changes
=============================

This section gives a brief overview of every *syntactic* change.
Several of these are discussed at greater length later.

Additions
---------

* Function argument and return value annotations (see below).  XXX

* :pep:`3102`: Keyword-only arguments.  Named parameters occurring
  after ``*args`` in the parameter list *must* be specified using
  keyword syntax in the call.  You can also use a bare ``*`` in the
  parameter list to indicate that you don't accept a variable-length
  argument list, but you do have keyword-only arguments.

* Keyword arguments are allowed after the list of base classes in a
  class definition.  This is used by the new convention for specifying
  a metaclass, but can be used for other purposes as well, as long as
  the metaclass supports it.

* :pep:`3104`: :keyword:`nonlocal` statement.  Using ``nonlocal x``
  you can now assign directly to a variable in an outer (but
  non-global) scope.  :keyword:`nonlocal` is a new reserved word.

* :pep:`3132`: Extended Iterable Unpacking.  You can now write things
  like ``a, b, *rest = some_sequence``.  And even ``*rest, a =
  stuff``.  The ``rest`` object is always a (possibly empty) list; the
  right-hand side may be any iterable.  Example::

    (a, *rest, b) = range(5)

  This sets *a* to ``0``, *b* to ``4``, and \*rest to ``[1, 2, 3]``.

* Dictionary comprehensions: ``{k: v for k, v in stuff}`` means the
  same thing as ``dict(stuff)`` but is more flexible.

* Set literals, e.g. ``{1, 2}``.  Note that ``{}`` is an empty
  dictionary; use ``set()`` for an empty set.  Set comprehensions are
  also supported; ``{x for x in stuff}`` means the same thing as
  ``set(stuff)`` but is more flexible.

* New octal literals, e.g. ``0o720`` (already in 2.6).  The old octal
  literals (``0720``) are gone.

* New binary literals, e.g. ``0b1010`` (already in 2.6).

* Bytes literals are introduced with a leading ``b`` or ``B``.

Changes
-------

* New :keyword:`raise` statement syntax: ``raise [expr [from expr]]``.
  Also note that string exceptions are no longer legal (:pep:`0352`).

* :keyword:`as` and :keyword:`with` are now reserved words.  (Since
  2.6, actually.)

* :keyword:`True`, :keyword:`False`, and :keyword:`None` are reserved
  words.  (2.6 partially enforced the restrictions on :keyword:`None`
  already.)

* Change from :keyword:`except` *exc*, *var* to
  :keyword:`except` *exc* :keyword:`as` *var*.  See :pep:`3110`.

* List comprehensions no longer support the syntactic form
  ``[... for var in item1, item2, ...]``.  Use
  ``[... for var in (item1, item2, ...)]`` instead.
  Also note that list comprehensions have different semantics: they
  are closer to syntactic sugar for a generator expression inside a
  :func:`list` constructor, and in particular the loop control
  variables are no longer leaked into the surrounding scope.

* The *ellipsis* (``...``) can be used as an atomic expression
  anywhere.  (Previously it was only allowed in slices.)  Also, it
  *must* now be spelled as ``...``.  (Previously it could also be
  spelled as ``. . .``, by a mere accident of the grammar.)

Removals
--------

* :pep:`3113`: Tuple parameter unpacking removed.  You can no longer
  write ``def foo(a, (b, c)): ...``.
  Use ``def foo(a, b_c): b, c = b_c`` instead.

* Removed backticks (use :func:`repr` instead).

* Removed ``<>`` (use ``!=`` instead).

* Removed keyword: :func:`exec` is no longer a keyword; it remains as
  a function.  (Fortunately the function syntax was also accepted in
  2.x.)  Also note that :func:`exec` no longer takes a stream argument;
  instead of ``exec(f)`` you can use ``exec(f.read())``.

* Integer literals no longer support a trailing ``l`` or ``L``.

* String literals no longer support a leading ``u`` or ``U``.

* The :keyword:`from` *module* :keyword:`import` ``*`` syntax is only
  allowed at the module level, no longer inside functions.

* The only acceptable syntax for relative imports is :keyword:`from`
  ``.``[*module*] :keyword:`import` *name*; :keyword:`import` forms
  not starting with ``.`` are always interpreted as absolute imports.
  (:pep:`0328`)



Changes Already Present In Python 2.6
=====================================

Since many users presumably make the jump straight from Python 2.5 to
Python 3.0, this section reminds the reader of new features that were
originally designed for Python 3.0 but that were back-ported to Python
2.6.  The corresponding sections in :ref:`whats-new-in-2.6` should be
consulted for longer descriptions.

* :ref:`pep-0343`.  The :keyword:`with` statement is now a standard
  feature and no longer needs to be imported from the ``__future__``.
  Also check out :ref:`new-26-context-managers` and
  :ref:`new-module-contextlib`.

* :ref:`pep-0366`.  This enhances the usefulness of the :option:`-m`
  option when the referenced module lives in a package.

* :ref:`pep-0370`.

* :ref:`pep-0371`.

* :ref:`pep-3101`.  Note: the 2.6 description mentions the
  :meth:`format` method for both 8-bit and Unicode strings.  In 3.0,
  only the :class:`str` type (text strings with Unicode support)
  supports this method; the :class:`bytes` type does not.  The plan is
  to eventually make this the only API for string formatting, and to
  start deprecating the ``%`` operator in Python 3.1.

* :ref:`pep-3105`.  This is now a standard feature and no longer needs
  to be imported from :mod:`__future__`.

* :ref:`pep-3110`.  The :keyword:`except` *exc* :keyword:`as` *var*
  syntax is now standard and :keyword:`except` *exc*, *var* is no
  longer supported.  (Of course, the :keyword:`as` *var* part is still
  optional.)

* :ref:`pep-3112`.  The ``b"..."`` string literal notation (and its
  variants like ``b'...'``, ``b"""..."""``, and ``br"..."``) now
  produces a literal of type :class:`bytes`.  More about
  :class:`bytes` below.

* :ref:`pep-3116`.  The :mod:`io` module is now the standard way of
  doing file I/O, and the initial values of :data:`sys.stdin`,
  :data:`sys.stdout` and :data:`sys.stderr` are now instances of
  :class:`io.TextIOBase`.  The builtin :func:`open` function is now an
  alias for :func:`io.open` and has additional keyword arguments
  *encoding*, *errors*, *newline* and *closefd*.  Also note that an
  invalid *mode* argument now raises :exc:`ValueError`, not
  :exc:`IOError`.

* :ref:`pep-3118`.  The old builtin :func:`buffer` is now really gone;
  the new builtin :func:`memoryview` provides (mostly) similar
  functionality.

* :ref:`pep-3119`.  The :mod:`abc` module and the ABCs defined in the
  :mod:`collections` module plays a slightly more prominent role in
  the language now, and builtin collection types like :class:`dict`
  and :class:`list` conform to the :class:`collections.MutableMapping`
  and :class:`collections.MutableSequence` ABC, respectively.

* :ref:`pep-3127`.  As mentioned above, the new octal literal
  notation is the only one supported, and binary literals have been
  added.

* :ref:`pep-3129`.  This speaks for itself.

* :ref:`pep-3141`.  The :mod:`numbers` module is another new use of
  ABCs, defining Python's "numeric tower".  Also note the new
  :mod:`fractions` module.


Library Changes
===============

XXX Brief overview of what's changed in the library.

* :pep:`3108`: stdlib reorganization.

* Killed :mod:`sets`.  Use the builtin :func:`set` function.

* XXX macfs, new, reconvert, stringold, xmllib, pcre, pypcre, strop

* XXX :pep:`4`

* XXX lib-old: Para, addpack, cmp, cmpcache, codehack, dircmp, dump,
  find, fmt, grep, lockfile, newdir, ni, packmail, poly, rand,
  statcache, tb, tzparse, util, whatsound, whrandom, zmod

* XXX Removed sys.exitfunc

* XXX Removed sys.exc_clear

* XXX Removed sys.exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback.  (sys.last_type
  etc. remain.)

* XXX array.read, array.write

* XXX operator.sequenceIncludes

* XXX thread.acquire_lock and thread.release_lock

* XXX UserXXX -> XXXMixin?

* XXX removed random.jumpahead API

* XXX cookie module revamps

* XXX heapq revamp


Strings And Bytes
=================

This section discusses the many changes in string 

* There is only one string type; its name is :class:`str` but its behavior and
  implementation are like :class:`unicode` in 2.x.

* The :class:`basestring` superclass has been removed. The ``2to3`` tool
  replaces every occurrence of :class:`basestring` with :class:`str`.

* :pep:`3137`: There is a new type, :class:`bytes`, to represent
  binary data (and encoded text, which is treated as binary data until
  you decide to decode it).  The :class:`str` and :class:`bytes` types
  cannot be mixed; you must always explicitly convert between them,
  using the :meth:`str.encode` (str -> bytes) or :meth:`bytes.decode`
  (bytes -> str) methods.

.. XXX add bytearray

* All backslashes in raw strings are interpreted literally.  This means that
  ``'\U'`` and ``'\u'`` escapes in raw strings are not treated specially.

* :pep:`3138`: :func:`repr` of a string no longer escapes all
  non-ASCII characters.  XXX

* :pep:`3112`: Bytes literals, e.g. ``b"abc"``, create :class:`bytes`
  instances.

* :pep:`3120`: UTF-8 default source encoding.

* :pep:`3131`: Non-ASCII identifiers.  (However, the standard library remains
  ASCII-only with the exception of contributor names in comments.)

* :pep:`3116`: New I/O Implementation.  The API is nearly 100% backwards
  compatible, but completely reimplemented (currently mostly in Python).  Also,
  binary files use bytes instead of strings.

* The :mod:`StringIO` and :mod:`cStringIO` modules are gone.  Instead, import
  :class:`io.StringIO` or :class:`io.BytesIO`.



:pep:`3101`: A New Approach To String Formatting
================================================

* A new system for  built-in string formatting operations replaces the
  ``%`` string  formatting operator.   (However, the ``%``  operator is
  still supported;  it will  be deprecated in  Python 3.1  and removed
  from the language at some later time.)

.. XXX expand this


:pep:`3106`: Revamping dict :meth:`dict.keys`, :meth:`dict.items` and :meth:`dict.values`
=========================================================================================

.. XXX expand this (but note that the "pitfalls" section currently has
.. XXX more detail :-)

* The :meth:`dict.iterkeys`, :meth:`dict.itervalues` and :meth:`dict.iteritems`
  methods have been removed.

* :meth:`dict.keys`, :meth:`dict.values` and :meth:`dict.items` return objects
  with set behavior that reference the underlying dict; these are often
  referred to as *dictionary views*.


:pep:`3107`: Function Annotations
=================================

.. XXX expand this

* A standardized way of annotating a function's parameters and return values.


Exception Stuff
===============

* :pep:`0352`: All exceptions must be derived (directly or indirectly)
  from :exc:`BaseException`.  This is the root of the exception
  hierarchy.  Most exceptions should actually be derived from
  :exc:`Exception`.  This is not a new recommendation, but the
  *requirement* to inherit from :exc:`BaseException` is new.  (Python
  2.6 still allowed classic classes to be raised, and placed no
  restriction on what you can catch.)

* :exc:`StandardError` was removed (in 2.6, actually).

* Dropping sequence behavior (slicing!) and :attr:`message` attribute of
  exception instances.

* :pep:`3109`: Raising exceptions.  You must now use ``raise Exception(args)``
  instead of ``raise Exception, args``.

* :pep:`3110`: Catching exceptions.  You must now use ``except SomeException as
  identifier:`` instead of ``except Exception, identifier:``

* :pep:`3134`: Exception chaining.  XXX

* A few exception messages are improved when Windows fails to load an extension
  module.  For example, ``error code 193`` is now ``%1 is not a valid Win32
  application``.  Strings now deal with non-English locales.


New Class And Metaclass Stuff
=============================

* Classic classes are gone.

* :pep:`3115`: New Metaclass Syntax.

* :pep:`3119`: Abstract Base Classes (ABCs); ``@abstractmethod`` and
  ``@abstractproperty`` decorators; collection ABCs.

* :pep:`3129`: Class decorators.

* :pep:`3141`: Numeric ABCs.


Other Language Changes
======================

* Moved :func:`intern` to :func:`sys.intern`.

* ``!=`` now returns the opposite of ``==``, unless ``==`` returns
  ``NotImplemented``.

* The concept of "unbound methods" was removed from the language.
  When referencing a method as a class attribute, you now get a plain
  function object.

* :meth:`__getslice__`, :meth:`__setslice__` and :meth:`__delslice__`
  were killed.  The syntax ``a[i:j]`` now translates to
  ``a.__getitem__(slice(i, j))`` (or :meth:`__setitem__` or
  :meth:`__delitem__`, when used as an assignment or deletion target,
  respectively).

* :pep:`3111`: :func:`raw_input` renamed to :func:`input`.  That is,
  the new :func:`input` function reads a line from :data:`sys.stdin`
  and returns it with the trailing newline stripped.  It raises
  :exc:`EOFError` if the input is terminated prematurely.  To get the
  old behavior of :func:`input`, use ``eval(input())``.

* :func:`xrange` renamed to :func:`range`, so :func:`range` will no
  longer produce a list but an iterable yielding integers when
  iterated over.  XXX dupe

* :pep:`3114`: ``.next()`` renamed to :meth:`__next__`, new builtin
  :func:`next` to call the :meth:`__next__` method on an object.

* :pep:`3135`: New :func:`super`.  You can now invoke :func:`super`
  without arguments and the right class and instance will
  automatically be chosen.  With arguments, its behavior is unchanged.

* :func:`zip`, :func:`map` and :func:`filter` return iterators.

* :data:`string.letters` and its friends (:data:`string.lowercase` and
  :data:`string.uppercase`) are gone.  Use
  :data:`string.ascii_letters` etc. instead.  (The reason for the
  removal is that :data:string.letters` and friends had
  locale-specific behavior, which is a bad idea for such
  attractively-named global "constants".)

* Removed: :func:`apply`.  Instead of ``apply(f, args)`` use
  ``f(*args)``.

* Removed :func:`callable`.  Instead of ``callable(f)`` you can use
  ``hasattr(f, '__call__')``.  The :func:`operator.isCallable` function
  is also gone.

* Removed :func:`coerce`.  This function no longer serves a purpose
  now that classic classes are gone.

* Removed :func:`execfile`.  Instead of ``execfile(fn)`` use
  ``exec(open(fn).read())``.

* Removed :class:`file`.  Use :func:`open`.

* Removed :func:`reduce`.  Use :func:`functools.reduce` if you really
  need it; however, 99 percent of the time an explicit :keyword:`for`
  loop is more readable.

* Removed :func:`reload`.  Use :func:`imp.reload`.  

* Removed. :meth:`dict.has_key` -- use the :keyword:`in` operator
  instead.

* The :meth:`__oct__` and :meth:`__hex__` special methods are removed
  -- :func:`oct` and :func:`hex` use :meth:`__index__` now to convert
  the argument to an integer.

* Removed support for :attr:`__members__` and :attr:`__methods__`.

* Renamed the boolean conversion C-level slot and method:
  ``nb_nonzero`` is now ``nb_bool`` and :meth:`__nonzero__` is now
  :meth:`__bool__`.

* Renamed module :mod:`__builtin__` to :mod:`builtins` (removing the
  underscores, adding an 's').  The :data:`__builtins__` variable
  found in most global namespaces is unchanged.  To modify a builtin,
  you should use :mod:`builtins`, not :data:`__builtins__`!

* Renamed function attributes :attr:`func_whatever` to
  :attr:`__whatever__`.  XXX list every single one.

* Removed :exc:`StandardError`.

* Removed METH_OLDARGS and WITH_CYCLE_GC.  XXX more.

.. ======================================================================


Optimizations
-------------

The net result of the 3.0 generalizations is that Python 3.0 runs the
pystone benchmark around 10% slower than Python 2.5.  Most likely the
biggest cause is the removal of special-casing for small integers.
There's room for improvement, but it will happen after 3.0 is
released!

.. ======================================================================


New, Improved, And Deprecated Modules
=====================================

As usual, Python's standard library received a number of enhancements and bug
fixes.  Here's a partial list of the most notable changes, sorted alphabetically
by module name. Consult the :file:`Misc/NEWS` file in the source tree for a more
complete list of changes, or look through the Subversion logs for all the
details.

* The :mod:`cPickle` module is gone.  Use :mod:`pickle` instead.  Eventually
  we'll have a transparent accelerator module.

* The :mod:`imageop` module is gone.

* The :mod:`audiodev`, :mod:`Bastion`, :mod:`bsddb185`, :mod:`exceptions`,
  :mod:`linuxaudiodev`, :mod:`md5`, :mod:`MimeWriter`, :mod:`mimify`,
  :mod:`popen2`, :mod:`rexec`, :mod:`sets`, :mod:`sha`, :mod:`stringold`,
  :mod:`strop`, :mod:`sunaudiodev`, :mod:`timing`, and :mod:`xmllib` modules are
  gone.

* The :mod:`bsddb` module is gone.  It is being maintained externally
  with its own release schedule better mirroring that of BerkeleyDB.
  See http://www.jcea.es/programacion/pybsddb.htm.

* The :mod:`new` module is gone.

* The functions :func:`os.tmpnam`, :func:`os.tempnam` and :func:`os.tmpfile`
  have been removed in favor of the :mod:`tempfile` module.

* The :mod:`tokenize` module has been changed to work with bytes.  The main
  entry point is now :func:`tokenize.tokenize`, instead of generate_tokens.
