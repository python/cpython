PYTHON DOCUMENTATION TO-DO LIST			-*- indented-text -*-
===============================


* array module:  methods read(), reverse(), write() of the array object.

* Document native package semantics.

* Figure out indexsubitem handling in HTML; some of them are wrong for the
  items being indexed.

* Update the pickle documentation to describe all of the current behavior;
  only a subset is described.  __reduce__, etc.

* Review libppath.tex for completeness, & system-specific behaviors.

* Finish upgrade to LaTeX2HTML 98.1.  Most important: figure out a way to
  avoid image creation, & if necessary, make sure image creation at least
  doesn't fail.

* Migrate myformat.sty to a pair of classes and a shared package, to complete
  the transition to LaTeX2e.

* Figure out the texinfo indexing and function-description markup, and make
  partparse.py do the right thing.  Or toss the info conversion (again).
