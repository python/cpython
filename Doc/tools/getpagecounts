PAPER=${PAPER:-letter}


cat <<EOF
This is the PostScript version of the standard Python documentation.
If you plan to print this, be aware that some of the documents are
long.  These files have the following page counts:

EOF


for PART in api ext lib mac ref tut ; do
    FILE=paper-$PAPER/$PART.ps
    PAGECOUNT=`grep -c '^%%Page:' $FILE`
    echo "	$PART.ps -- $PAGECOUNT pages"
done
