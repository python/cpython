\begin{abstract}
\noindent
This document describes how to spammify sprockets.  It is a useful
example of a Python HOWTO document.  It is not dependent on any
particular sprocket implementation, and includes a Python-based
implementation in the \module{sprunkit} module.
\end{abstract}

\tableofcontents

Spammifying sprockets from Python is both fun and entertaining.
Applying the techniques described here, you can also fill your hard
disk quite effectively.

\section{What is Sprocket Spammification?}

You have to ask?  It's the only thing to do to your sprockets!


\section{Why Use Python?}

Python is an excellent language from which to spammify your sprockets
since you can do it on any platform.


\section{Software Requirements}

You need to have the following software installed:

% The {itemize} environment uses a bullet for each \item.  If you want the 
% \item's numbered, use the {enumerate} environment instead.
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Python 1.9.
  \item  Some sprocket definition files.
  \item  At least one sprocket system implementation.
\end{itemize}

Note that the \module{sprunkit} is provided with this package and
implements ActiveSprockets in Python.


% The preceding sections will have been written in a gentler,
% introductory style.  You may also wish to include a reference
% section, documenting all the functions/exceptions/constants.
% Often, these will be placed in separate files and input like this:

\input{module}


\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Python HOWTO document, use markup like
this:

\begin{verbatim}
\appendix

\section{This is an Appendix}

To create an appendix in a Python HOWTO document, ....


\section{This is another}

Just add another \section{}, but don't say \appendix again.
\end{verbatim}


\end{document}
