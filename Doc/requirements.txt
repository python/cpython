# Requirements to build the Python documentation
#
# Note that when updating this file, you will likely also have to update
# the Doc/constraints.txt file.

# The Sphinx version is pinned so that new versions that introduce new warnings
# won't suddenly cause build failures. Updating the version is fine as long
# as no warnings are raised by doing so.
# Keep this version in sync with ``Doc/conf.py``.
