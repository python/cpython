About these documents
=====================


These documents are generated from `reStructuredText`_ sources by `Sphinx`_, a
document processor specifically written for the Python documentation.

.. _reStructuredText: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/

.. In the online version of these documents, you can submit comments and suggest
   changes directly on the documentation pages.

Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer
effort, just like Python itself.  If you want to contribute, please take a
look at the :ref:`reporting-bugs` page for information on how to do so.  New
volunteers are always welcome!

Many thanks go to:

* Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset
  and writer of much of the content;
* the `Docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
* Fredrik Lundh for his Alternative Python Reference project from which Sphinx
  got many good ideas.


Contributors to the Python Documentation
----------------------------------------

Many people have contributed to the Python language, the Python standard
library, and the Python documentation.  See :source:`Misc/ACKS` in the Python
source distribution for a partial list of contributors.

It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community
that Python has such wonderful documentation -- Thank You!
