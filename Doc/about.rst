About this documentation
========================


Python's documentation is generated from `reStructuredText`_ sources
using `Sphinx`_, a documentation generator originally created for Python
and now maintained as an independent project.

.. _reStructuredText: https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html
.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/

.. In the online version of these documents, you can submit comments and suggest
   changes directly on the documentation pages.

Development of the documentation and its toolchain is an entirely volunteer
effort, just like Python itself.  If you want to contribute, please take a
look at the :ref:`reporting-bugs` page for information on how to do so.  New
volunteers are always welcome!

Many thanks go to:

* Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset
  and author of much of the content;
* the `Docutils <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
* Fredrik Lundh for his Alternative Python Reference project from which Sphinx
  got many good ideas.

It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community
that Python has such wonderful documentation -- Thank You!
