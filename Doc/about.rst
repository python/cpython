About these documents
=====================


These documents are generated from `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sf.net/rst.html>`_ sources by *Sphinx*, a document processor
specifically written for the Python documentation.

.. In the online version of these documents, you can submit comments and suggest
   changes directly on the documentation pages.

Development of the documentation and its toolchain takes place on the
docs@python.org mailing list.  We're always looking for volunteers wanting
to help with the docs, so feel free to send a mail there!

Many thanks go to:

* Fred L. Drake, Jr., the creator of the original Python documentation toolset
  and writer of much of the content;
* the `Docutils <http://docutils.sf.net/>`_ project for creating
  reStructuredText and the Docutils suite;
* Fredrik Lundh for his `Alternative Python Reference
  <http://effbot.org/zone/pyref.htm>`_ project from which Sphinx got many good
  ideas.

See :ref:`reporting-bugs` for information how to report bugs in this
documentation, or Python itself.

.. including the ACKS file here so that it can be maintained separately
.. include:: ACKS.txt

It is only with the input and contributions of the Python community
that Python has such wonderful documentation -- Thank You!
