History and License
*******************


History of the software
=======================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a
successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to
form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see
http://www.zope.com/).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created
specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a
sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org/ for the Open
Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also
been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

.. note::

   GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.  All
   Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without
   making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to
   combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others
   don't.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to
make these releases possible.

   Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
   - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
     between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
     version is still 5 times faster, though.
   - Arguments more compliant with python standard
