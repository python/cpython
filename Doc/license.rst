History and License
*******************


History of the software
=======================

Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl/) in the Netherlands as a
successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's principal author,
although it includes many contributions from others.

In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National
Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) in Reston,
Virginia where he released several versions of the software.

In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to
form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same year, the PythonLabs
team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope Corporation; see
https://www.zope.org/).  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created
specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a
sponsoring member of the PSF.

All Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org/ for the Open
Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also
been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases.

+----------------+--------------+------------+------------+-----------------+

.. note::

   GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under the GPL.  All
   Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute a modified version without
   making your changes open source. The GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to
   combine Python with other software that is released under the GPL; the others
   don't.

Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's direction to
make these releases possible.


Terms and conditions for accessing or otherwise using Python
============================================================

Python software and documentation are licensed under the
:ref:`PSF License Agreement <PSF-license>`.

Starting with Python 3.8.6, examples, recipes, and other code in
the documentation are dual licensed under the PSF License Agreement
and the :ref:`Zero-Clause BSD license <BSD0>`.

Some software incorporated into Python is under different licenses.
The licenses are listed with code falling under that license.
See :ref:`OtherLicenses` for an incomplete list of these licenses.

   - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion

     version is still 5 times faster, though.
   - Arguments more compliant with Python standard

OpenSSL
-------

The modules :mod:`hashlib`, :mod:`posix`, :mod:`ssl`, :mod:`crypt` use
the OpenSSL library for added performance if made available by the
operating system. Additionally, the Windows and macOS installers for
Python may include a copy of the OpenSSL libraries, so we include a copy
of the OpenSSL license here::


  LICENSE ISSUES
  ==============

  The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of
  the OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit.
  See below for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style
  Open Source licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL
  please contact openssl-core@openssl.org.
