installation.

Hardcore cypherpunks will probably find the Python Cryptography Kit of
further interest; the package adds built-in modules for DES and IDEA
encryption, and provides a Python module for reading and decrypting
PGP files.  The Python Cryptography Kit is not distributed with Python
but available separately.  See the URL
\file{http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/\%7Efnord/crypt.html} for more information.
