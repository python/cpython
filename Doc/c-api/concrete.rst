**********************
Concrete Objects Layer
**********************

The functions in this chapter are specific to certain Python object types.
Passing them an object of the wrong type is not a good idea; if you receive an
object from a Python program and you are not sure that it has the right type,
you must perform a type check first; for example, to check that an object is a
dictionary, use :c:func:`PyDict_Check`.  The chapter is structured like the
"family tree" of Python object types.

.. warning::

   While the functions described in this chapter carefully check the type of the
   objects which are passed in, many of them do not check for ``NULL`` being passed
   instead of a valid object.  Allowing ``NULL`` to be passed in can cause memory
   access violations and immediate termination of the interpreter.

Fundamental Objects
===================

This section describes Python type objects and the singleton object ``None``.

.. _sequenceobjects:

Sequence Objects
================

.. index:: pair: object; sequence

Generic operations on sequence objects were discussed in the previous chapter;
this section deals with the specific kinds of sequence objects that are
intrinsic to the Python language.
