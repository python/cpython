.. module:: re
   :synopsis: Regular expression operations.

.. moduleauthor:: Fredrik Lundh <fredrik@pythonware.com>
.. sectionauthor:: Andrew M. Kuchling <amk@amk.ca>

**Source code:** :source:`Lib/re/`

--------------

This module provides regular expression matching operations similar to
those found in Perl.

Both patterns and strings to be searched can be Unicode strings (:class:`str`)
as well as 8-bit strings (:class:`bytes`).
However, Unicode strings and 8-bit strings cannot be mixed:
that is, you cannot match a Unicode string with a bytes pattern or
vice-versa; similarly, when asking for a substitution, the replacement
string must be of the same type as both the pattern and the search string.

Regular expressions use the backslash character (``'\'``) to indicate
special forms or to allow special characters to be used without invoking
their special meaning.  This collides with Python's usage of the same
character for the same purpose in string literals; for example, to match
a literal backslash, one might have to write ``'\\\\'`` as the pattern
string, because the regular expression must be ``\\``, and each
backslash must be expressed as ``\\`` inside a regular Python string
literal. Also, please note that any invalid escape sequences in Python's
usage of the backslash in string literals now generate a :exc:`SyntaxWarning`
and in the future this will become a :exc:`SyntaxError`. This behaviour
will happen even if it is a valid escape sequence for a regular expression.

The solution is to use Python's raw string notation for regular expression
patterns; backslashes are not handled in any special way in a string literal
prefixed with ``'r'``.  So ``r"\n"`` is a two-character string containing
``'\'`` and ``'n'``, while ``"\n"`` is a one-character string containing a
newline.  Usually patterns will be expressed in Python code using this raw
string notation.

It is important to note that most regular expression operations are available as
module-level functions and methods on
:ref:`compiled regular expressions <re-objects>`.  The functions are shortcuts
that don't require you to compile a regex object first, but miss some
fine-tuning parameters.

   which has an API compatible with the standard library :mod:`re` module,
   but offers additional functionality and a more thorough Unicode support.


.. _re-syntax:

Regular Expression Syntax
-------------------------

A regular expression (or RE) specifies a set of strings that matches it; the
functions in this module let you check if a particular string matches a given
regular expression (or if a given regular expression matches a particular
string, which comes down to the same thing).

Regular expressions can be concatenated to form new regular expressions; if *A*
and *B* are both regular expressions, then *AB* is also a regular expression.
In general, if a string *p* matches *A* and another string *q* matches *B*, the
string *pq* will match AB.  This holds unless *A* or *B* contain low precedence
operations; boundary conditions between *A* and *B*; or have numbered group
references.  Thus, complex expressions can easily be constructed from simpler
primitive expressions like the ones described here.  For details of the theory
and implementation of regular expressions, consult the Friedl book [Frie09]_,
or almost any textbook about compiler construction.

A brief explanation of the format of regular expressions follows.  For further
information and a gentler presentation, consult the :ref:`regex-howto`.

Regular expressions can contain both special and ordinary characters. Most
ordinary characters, like ``'A'``, ``'a'``, or ``'0'``, are the simplest regular
expressions; they simply match themselves.  You can concatenate ordinary
characters, so ``last`` matches the string ``'last'``.  (In the rest of this
section, we'll write RE's in ``this special style``, usually without quotes, and
strings to be matched ``'in single quotes'``.)

Some characters, like ``'|'`` or ``'('``, are special. Special
characters either stand for classes of ordinary characters, or affect
how the regular expressions around them are interpreted.

Repetition operators or quantifiers (``*``, ``+``, ``?``, ``{m,n}``, etc) cannot be
directly nested. This avoids ambiguity with the non-greedy modifier suffix
``?``, and with other modifiers in other implementations. To apply a second
repetition to an inner repetition, parentheses may be used. For example,
the expression ``(?:a{6})*`` matches any multiple of six ``'a'`` characters.


The special characters are:

.. index:: single: . (dot); in regular expressions

``.``
   (Dot.)  In the default mode, this matches any character except a newline.  If
   the :const:`DOTALL` flag has been specified, this matches any character
   including a newline.  ``(?s:.)`` matches any character regardless of flags.

.. index:: single: ^ (caret); in regular expressions

``^``
   (Caret.)  Matches the start of the string, and in :const:`MULTILINE` mode also
   matches immediately after each newline.

.. index:: single: $ (dollar); in regular expressions

``$``
   Matches the end of the string or just before the newline at the end of the
   string, and in :const:`MULTILINE` mode also matches before a newline.  ``foo``
   matches both 'foo' and 'foobar', while the regular expression ``foo$`` matches
   only 'foo'.  More interestingly, searching for ``foo.$`` in ``'foo1\nfoo2\n'``
   matches 'foo2' normally, but 'foo1' in :const:`MULTILINE` mode; searching for
   a single ``$`` in ``'foo\n'`` will find two (empty) matches: one just before
   the newline, and one at the end of the string.

.. index:: single: * (asterisk); in regular expressions

``*``
   Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or more repetitions of the preceding RE, as
   many repetitions as are possible.  ``ab*`` will match 'a', 'ab', or 'a' followed
   by any number of 'b's.

.. index:: single: + (plus); in regular expressions

``+``
   Causes the resulting RE to match 1 or more repetitions of the preceding RE.
   ``ab+`` will match 'a' followed by any non-zero number of 'b's; it will not
   match just 'a'.

.. index:: single: ? (question mark); in regular expressions

``?``
   Causes the resulting RE to match 0 or 1 repetitions of the preceding RE.
   ``ab?`` will match either 'a' or 'ab'.

.. index::
   single: *?; in regular expressions
   single: +?; in regular expressions
   single: ??; in regular expressions

``*?``, ``+?``, ``??``
   The ``'*'``, ``'+'``, and ``'?'`` quantifiers are all :dfn:`greedy`; they match
   as much text as possible.  Sometimes this behaviour isn't desired; if the RE
   ``<.*>`` is matched against ``'<a> b <c>'``, it will match the entire
   string, and not just ``'<a>'``.  Adding ``?`` after the quantifier makes it
   perform the match in :dfn:`non-greedy` or :dfn:`minimal` fashion; as *few*
   characters as possible will be matched.  Using the RE ``<.*?>`` will match
   only ``'<a>'``.

.. index::
   single: *+; in regular expressions
   single: ++; in regular expressions
   single: ?+; in regular expressions

``*+``, ``++``, ``?+``
  Like the ``'*'``, ``'+'``, and ``'?'`` quantifiers, those where ``'+'`` is
  appended also match as many times as possible.
  However, unlike the true greedy quantifiers, these do not allow
  back-tracking when the expression following it fails to match.
  These are known as :dfn:`possessive` quantifiers.
  For example, ``a*a`` will match ``'aaaa'`` because the ``a*`` will match
  all 4 ``'a'``\ s, but, when the final ``'a'`` is encountered, the
  expression is backtracked so that in the end the ``a*`` ends up matching
  3 ``'a'``\ s total, and the fourth ``'a'`` is matched by the final ``'a'``.
  However, when ``a*+a`` is used to match ``'aaaa'``, the ``a*+`` will
  match all 4 ``'a'``, but when the final ``'a'`` fails to find any more
  characters to match, the expression cannot be backtracked and will thus
  fail to match.
  ``x*+``, ``x++`` and ``x?+`` are equivalent to ``(?>x*)``, ``(?>x+)``
  and ``(?>x?)`` correspondingly.

.. index::
   single: {} (curly brackets); in regular expressions

``{m}``
   Specifies that exactly *m* copies of the previous RE should be matched; fewer
   matches cause the entire RE not to match.  For example, ``a{6}`` will match
   exactly six ``'a'`` characters, but not five.

``{m,n}``
   Causes the resulting RE to match from *m* to *n* repetitions of the preceding
   RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible.  For example,
   ``a{3,5}`` will match from 3 to 5 ``'a'`` characters.  Omitting *m* specifies a
   lower bound of zero,  and omitting *n* specifies an infinite upper bound.  As an
   example, ``a{4,}b`` will match ``'aaaab'`` or a thousand ``'a'`` characters
   followed by a ``'b'``, but not ``'aaab'``. The comma may not be omitted or the
   modifier would be confused with the previously described form.

``{m,n}?``
   Causes the resulting RE to match from *m* to *n* repetitions of the preceding
   RE, attempting to match as *few* repetitions as possible.  This is the
   non-greedy version of the previous quantifier.  For example, on the
   6-character string ``'aaaaaa'``, ``a{3,5}`` will match 5 ``'a'`` characters,
   while ``a{3,5}?`` will only match 3 characters.

``{m,n}+``
   Causes the resulting RE to match from *m* to *n* repetitions of the
   preceding RE, attempting to match as many repetitions as possible
   *without* establishing any backtracking points.
   This is the possessive version of the quantifier above.
   For example, on the 6-character string ``'aaaaaa'``, ``a{3,5}+aa``
   attempt to match 5 ``'a'`` characters, then, requiring 2 more ``'a'``\ s,
   will need more characters than available and thus fail, while
   ``a{3,5}aa`` will match with ``a{3,5}`` capturing 5, then 4 ``'a'``\ s
   by backtracking and then the final 2 ``'a'``\ s are matched by the final
   ``aa`` in the pattern.
   ``x{m,n}+`` is equivalent to ``(?>x{m,n})``.

.. index:: single: \ (backslash); in regular expressions

``\``
   Either escapes special characters (permitting you to match characters like
   ``'*'``, ``'?'``, and so forth), or signals a special sequence; special
   sequences are discussed below.

   If you're not using a raw string to express the pattern, remember that Python
   also uses the backslash as an escape sequence in string literals; if the escape
   sequence isn't recognized by Python's parser, the backslash and subsequent
   character are included in the resulting string.  However, if Python would
   recognize the resulting sequence, the backslash should be repeated twice.  This
   is complicated and hard to understand, so it's highly recommended that you use
   raw strings for all but the simplest expressions.

.. index::
   single: [] (square brackets); in regular expressions

``[]``
   Used to indicate a set of characters.  In a set:

   * Characters can be listed individually, e.g. ``[amk]`` will match ``'a'``,
     ``'m'``, or ``'k'``.

   .. index:: single: - (minus); in regular expressions

   * Ranges of characters can be indicated by giving two characters and separating
     them by a ``'-'``, for example ``[a-z]`` will match any lowercase ASCII letter,
     ``[0-5][0-9]`` will match all the two-digits numbers from ``00`` to ``59``, and
     ``[0-9A-Fa-f]`` will match any hexadecimal digit.  If ``-`` is escaped (e.g.
     ``[a\-z]``) or if it's placed as the first or last character
     (e.g. ``[-a]`` or ``[a-]``), it will match a literal ``'-'``.

   * Special characters except backslash lose their special meaning inside sets.
     For example,
     ``[(+*)]`` will match any of the literal characters ``'('``, ``'+'``,
     ``'*'``, or ``')'``.

   .. index:: single: \ (backslash); in regular expressions

   * Backslash either escapes characters which have special meaning in a set
     such as ``'-'``, ``']'``, ``'^'`` and ``'\\'`` itself or signals
     a special sequence which represents a single character such as
     ``\xa0`` or ``\n`` or a character class such as ``\w`` or ``\S``
     (defined below).
     Note that ``\b`` represents a single "backspace" character,
     not a word boundary as outside a set, and numeric escapes
     such as ``\1`` are always octal escapes, not group references.
     Special sequences which do not match a single character such as ``\A``
     and ``\Z`` are not allowed.

   .. index:: single: ^ (caret); in regular expressions

   * Characters that are not within a range can be matched by :dfn:`complementing`
     the set.  If the first character of the set is ``'^'``, all the characters
     that are *not* in the set will be matched.  For example, ``[^5]`` will match
     any character except ``'5'``, and ``[^^]`` will match any character except
     ``'^'``.  ``^`` has no special meaning if it's not the first character in
     the set.

   * To match a literal ``']'`` inside a set, precede it with a backslash, or
     place it at the beginning of the set.  For example, both ``[()[\]{}]`` and
     ``[]()[{}]`` will match a right bracket, as well as left bracket, braces,
     and parentheses.

   .. .. index:: single: --; in regular expressions
   .. .. index:: single: &&; in regular expressions
   .. .. index:: single: ~~; in regular expressions
   .. .. index:: single: ||; in regular expressions

   * Support of nested sets and set operations as in `Unicode Technical
     Standard #18`_ might be added in the future.  This would change the
     syntax, so to facilitate this change a :exc:`FutureWarning` will be raised
     in ambiguous cases for the time being.
     That includes sets starting with a literal ``'['`` or containing literal
     character sequences ``'--'``, ``'&&'``, ``'~~'``, and ``'||'``.  To
     avoid a warning escape them with a backslash.

   .. _Unicode Technical Standard #18: https://unicode.org/reports/tr18/

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      :exc:`FutureWarning` is raised if a character set contains constructs
      that will change semantically in the future.

.. index:: single: | (vertical bar); in regular expressions

``|``
   ``A|B``, where *A* and *B* can be arbitrary REs, creates a regular expression that
   will match either *A* or *B*.  An arbitrary number of REs can be separated by the
   ``'|'`` in this way.  This can be used inside groups (see below) as well.  As
   the target string is scanned, REs separated by ``'|'`` are tried from left to
   right. When one pattern completely matches, that branch is accepted. This means
   that once *A* matches, *B* will not be tested further, even if it would
   produce a longer overall match.  In other words, the ``'|'`` operator is never
   greedy.  To match a literal ``'|'``, use ``\|``, or enclose it inside a
   character class, as in ``[|]``.

.. index::
   single: () (parentheses); in regular expressions

``(...)``
   Matches whatever regular expression is inside the parentheses, and indicates the
   start and end of a group; the contents of a group can be retrieved after a match
   has been performed, and can be matched later in the string with the ``\number``
   special sequence, described below.  To match the literals ``'('`` or ``')'``,
   use ``\(`` or ``\)``, or enclose them inside a character class: ``[(]``, ``[)]``.

.. index:: single: (?; in regular expressions

``(?...)``
   This is an extension notation (a ``'?'`` following a ``'('`` is not meaningful
   otherwise).  The first character after the ``'?'`` determines what the meaning
   and further syntax of the construct is. Extensions usually do not create a new
   group; ``(?P<name>...)`` is the only exception to this rule. Following are the
   currently supported extensions.

``(?aiLmsux)``
   (One or more letters from the set
   ``'a'``, ``'i'``, ``'L'``, ``'m'``, ``'s'``, ``'u'``, ``'x'``.)
   The group matches the empty string;
   the letters set the corresponding flags for the entire regular expression:

   * :const:`re.A` (ASCII-only matching)
   * :const:`re.I` (ignore case)
   * :const:`re.L` (locale dependent)
   * :const:`re.M` (multi-line)
   * :const:`re.S` (dot matches all)
   * :const:`re.U` (Unicode matching)
   * :const:`re.X` (verbose)

   (The flags are described in :ref:`contents-of-module-re`.)
   This is useful if you wish to include the flags as part of the
   regular expression, instead of passing a *flag* argument to the
   :func:`re.compile` function.
   Flags should be used first in the expression string.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.11
      This construction can only be used at the start of the expression.

.. index:: single: (?:; in regular expressions

``(?:...)``
   A non-capturing version of regular parentheses.  Matches whatever regular
   expression is inside the parentheses, but the substring matched by the group
   *cannot* be retrieved after performing a match or referenced later in the
   pattern.

``(?aiLmsux-imsx:...)``
   (Zero or more letters from the set
   ``'a'``, ``'i'``, ``'L'``, ``'m'``, ``'s'``, ``'u'``, ``'x'``,
   optionally followed by ``'-'`` followed by
   one or more letters from the ``'i'``, ``'m'``, ``'s'``, ``'x'``.)
   The letters set or remove the corresponding flags for the part of the expression:

   * :const:`re.A` (ASCII-only matching)
   * :const:`re.I` (ignore case)
   * :const:`re.L` (locale dependent)
   * :const:`re.M` (multi-line)
   * :const:`re.S` (dot matches all)
   * :const:`re.U` (Unicode matching)
   * :const:`re.X` (verbose)

   (The flags are described in :ref:`contents-of-module-re`.)

   The letters ``'a'``, ``'L'`` and ``'u'`` are mutually exclusive when used
   as inline flags, so they can't be combined or follow ``'-'``.  Instead,
   when one of them appears in an inline group, it overrides the matching mode
   in the enclosing group.  In Unicode patterns ``(?a:...)`` switches to
   ASCII-only matching, and ``(?u:...)`` switches to Unicode matching
   (default).  In bytes patterns ``(?L:...)`` switches to locale dependent
   matching, and ``(?a:...)`` switches to ASCII-only matching (default).
   This override is only in effect for the narrow inline group, and the
   original matching mode is restored outside of the group.

   .. versionadded:: 3.6

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      The letters ``'a'``, ``'L'`` and ``'u'`` also can be used in a group.

``(?>...)``
   Attempts to match ``...`` as if it was a separate regular expression, and
   if successful, continues to match the rest of the pattern following it.
   If the subsequent pattern fails to match, the stack can only be unwound
   to a point *before* the ``(?>...)`` because once exited, the expression,
   known as an :dfn:`atomic group`, has thrown away all stack points within
   itself.
   Thus, ``(?>.*).`` would never match anything because first the ``.*``
   would match all characters possible, then, having nothing left to match,
   the final ``.`` would fail to match.
   Since there are no stack points saved in the Atomic Group, and there is
   no stack point before it, the entire expression would thus fail to match.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. index:: single: (?P<; in regular expressions

``(?P<name>...)``
   Similar to regular parentheses, but the substring matched by the group is
   accessible via the symbolic group name *name*.  Group names must be valid
   Python identifiers, and in :class:`bytes` patterns they can only contain
   bytes in the ASCII range.  Each group name must be defined only once within
   a regular expression.  A symbolic group is also a numbered group, just as if
   the group were not named.

   Named groups can be referenced in three contexts.  If the pattern is
   ``(?P<quote>['"]).*?(?P=quote)`` (i.e. matching a string quoted with either
   single or double quotes):

   +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | Context of reference to group "quote" | Ways to reference it             |
   +=======================================+==================================+
   | in the same pattern itself            | * ``(?P=quote)`` (as shown)      |
   |                                       | * ``\1``                         |
   +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | when processing match object *m*      | * ``m.group('quote')``           |
   |                                       | * ``m.end('quote')`` (etc.)      |
   +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+
   | in a string passed to the *repl*      | * ``\g<quote>``                  |
   | argument of ``re.sub()``              | * ``\g<1>``                      |
   |                                       | * ``\1``                         |
   +---------------------------------------+----------------------------------+

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      In :class:`bytes` patterns, group *name* can only contain bytes
      in the ASCII range (``b'\x00'``-``b'\x7f'``).

.. index:: single: (?P=; in regular expressions

``(?P=name)``
   A backreference to a named group; it matches whatever text was matched by the
   earlier group named *name*.

.. index:: single: (?#; in regular expressions

``(?#...)``
   A comment; the contents of the parentheses are simply ignored.

.. index:: single: (?=; in regular expressions

``(?=...)``
   Matches if ``...`` matches next, but doesn't consume any of the string.  This is
   called a :dfn:`lookahead assertion`.  For example, ``Isaac (?=Asimov)`` will match
   ``'Isaac '`` only if it's followed by ``'Asimov'``.

.. index:: single: (?!; in regular expressions

``(?!...)``
   Matches if ``...`` doesn't match next.  This is a :dfn:`negative lookahead assertion`.
   For example, ``Isaac (?!Asimov)`` will match ``'Isaac '`` only if it's *not*
   followed by ``'Asimov'``.

.. index:: single: (?<=; in regular expressions

``(?<=...)``
   Matches if the current position in the string is preceded by a match for ``...``
   that ends at the current position.  This is called a :dfn:`positive lookbehind
   assertion`. ``(?<=abc)def`` will find a match in ``'abcdef'``, since the
   lookbehind will back up 3 characters and check if the contained pattern matches.
   The contained pattern must only match strings of some fixed length, meaning that
   ``abc`` or ``a|b`` are allowed, but ``a*`` and ``a{3,4}`` are not.  Note that
   patterns which start with positive lookbehind assertions will not match at the
   beginning of the string being searched; you will most likely want to use the
   :func:`search` function rather than the :func:`match` function:

      >>> import re
      >>> m = re.search('(?<=abc)def', 'abcdef')
      >>> m.group(0)
      'def'

   This example looks for a word following a hyphen:

      >>> m = re.search(r'(?<=-)\w+', 'spam-egg')
      >>> m.group(0)
      'egg'

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added support for group references of fixed length.

.. index:: single: (?<!; in regular expressions

``(?<!...)``
   Matches if the current position in the string is not preceded by a match for
   ``...``.  This is called a :dfn:`negative lookbehind assertion`.  Similar to
   positive lookbehind assertions, the contained pattern must only match strings of
   some fixed length.  Patterns which start with negative lookbehind assertions may
   match at the beginning of the string being searched.

.. _re-conditional-expression:
.. index:: single: (?(; in regular expressions

``(?(id/name)yes-pattern|no-pattern)``
   Will try to match with ``yes-pattern`` if the group with given *id* or
   *name* exists, and with ``no-pattern`` if it doesn't. ``no-pattern`` is
   optional and can be omitted. For example,
   ``(<)?(\w+@\w+(?:\.\w+)+)(?(1)>|$)`` is a poor email matching pattern, which
   will match with ``'<user@host.com>'`` as well as ``'user@host.com'``, but
   not with ``'<user@host.com'`` nor ``'user@host.com>'``.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Group *id* can only contain ASCII digits.
      In :class:`bytes` patterns, group *name* can only contain bytes
      in the ASCII range (``b'\x00'``-``b'\x7f'``).


.. _re-special-sequences:

The special sequences consist of ``'\'`` and a character from the list below.
If the ordinary character is not an ASCII digit or an ASCII letter, then the
resulting RE will match the second character.  For example, ``\$`` matches the
character ``'$'``.

.. index:: single: \ (backslash); in regular expressions

``\number``
   Matches the contents of the group of the same number.  Groups are numbered
   starting from 1.  For example, ``(.+) \1`` matches ``'the the'`` or ``'55 55'``,
   but not ``'thethe'`` (note the space after the group).  This special sequence
   can only be used to match one of the first 99 groups.  If the first digit of
   *number* is 0, or *number* is 3 octal digits long, it will not be interpreted as
   a group match, but as the character with octal value *number*. Inside the
   ``'['`` and ``']'`` of a character class, all numeric escapes are treated as
   characters.

.. index:: single: \A; in regular expressions

``\A``
   Matches only at the start of the string.

.. index:: single: \b; in regular expressions

``\b``
   Matches the empty string, but only at the beginning or end of a word.
   A word is defined as a sequence of word characters.
   Note that formally, ``\b`` is defined as the boundary
   between a ``\w`` and a ``\W`` character (or vice versa),
   or between ``\w`` and the beginning or end of the string.
   This means that ``r'\bat\b'`` matches ``'at'``, ``'at.'``, ``'(at)'``,
   and ``'as at ay'`` but not ``'attempt'`` or ``'atlas'``.

   The default word characters in Unicode (str) patterns
   are Unicode alphanumerics and the underscore,
   but this can be changed by using the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag.
   Word boundaries are determined by the current locale
   if the :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` flag is used.

   .. note::

      Inside a character range, ``\b`` represents the backspace character,
      for compatibility with Python's string literals.

.. index:: single: \B; in regular expressions

``\B``
   Matches the empty string,
   but only when it is *not* at the beginning or end of a word.
   This means that ``r'at\B'`` matches ``'athens'``, ``'atom'``,
   ``'attorney'``, but not ``'at'``, ``'at.'``, or ``'at!'``.
   ``\B`` is the opposite of ``\b``,
   so word characters in Unicode (str) patterns
   are Unicode alphanumerics or the underscore,
   although this can be changed by using the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag.
   Word boundaries are determined by the current locale
   if the :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` flag is used.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.14
      ``\B`` now matches empty input string.

.. index:: single: \d; in regular expressions

``\d``
   For Unicode (str) patterns:
      Matches any Unicode decimal digit
      (that is, any character in Unicode character category `[Nd]`__).
      This includes ``[0-9]``, and also many other digit characters.

      Matches ``[0-9]`` if the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used.

      __ https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.0.0/ch04.pdf#G134153

   For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:
      Matches any decimal digit in the ASCII character set;
      this is equivalent to ``[0-9]``.

.. index:: single: \D; in regular expressions

``\D``
   Matches any character which is not a decimal digit.
   This is the opposite of ``\d``.

   Matches ``[^0-9]`` if the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used.

.. index:: single: \s; in regular expressions

``\s``
   For Unicode (str) patterns:
      Matches Unicode whitespace characters (as defined by :py:meth:`str.isspace`).
      This includes ``[ \t\n\r\f\v]``, and also many other characters, for example the
      non-breaking spaces mandated by typography rules in many languages.

      Matches ``[ \t\n\r\f\v]`` if the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used.

   For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:
      Matches characters considered whitespace in the ASCII character set;
      this is equivalent to ``[ \t\n\r\f\v]``.

.. index:: single: \S; in regular expressions

``\S``
   Matches any character which is not a whitespace character. This is
   the opposite of ``\s``.

   Matches ``[^ \t\n\r\f\v]`` if the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used.

.. index:: single: \w; in regular expressions

``\w``
   For Unicode (str) patterns:
      Matches Unicode word characters;
      this includes all Unicode alphanumeric characters
      (as defined by :py:meth:`str.isalnum`),
      as well as the underscore (``_``).

      Matches ``[a-zA-Z0-9_]`` if the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used.

   For 8-bit (bytes) patterns:
      Matches characters considered alphanumeric in the ASCII character set;
      this is equivalent to ``[a-zA-Z0-9_]``.
      If the :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` flag is used,
      matches characters considered alphanumeric in the current locale and the underscore.

.. index:: single: \W; in regular expressions

``\W``
   Matches any character which is not a word character.
   This is the opposite of ``\w``.
   By default, matches non-underscore (``_``) characters
   for which :py:meth:`str.isalnum` returns ``False``.

   Matches ``[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`` if the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used.

   If the :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` flag is used,
   matches characters which are neither alphanumeric in the current locale
   nor the underscore.

.. index:: single: \Z; in regular expressions

``\Z``
   Matches only at the end of the string.

.. index::
   single: \a; in regular expressions
   single: \b; in regular expressions
   single: \f; in regular expressions
   single: \n; in regular expressions
   single: \N; in regular expressions
   single: \r; in regular expressions
   single: \t; in regular expressions
   single: \u; in regular expressions
   single: \U; in regular expressions
   single: \v; in regular expressions
   single: \x; in regular expressions
   single: \\; in regular expressions

Most of the :ref:`escape sequences <escape-sequences>` supported by Python
string literals are also accepted by the regular expression parser::

   \a      \b      \f      \n
   \N      \r      \t      \u
   \U      \v      \x      \\

(Note that ``\b`` is used to represent word boundaries, and means "backspace"
only inside character classes.)

``'\u'``, ``'\U'``, and ``'\N'`` escape sequences are
only recognized in Unicode (str) patterns.
In bytes patterns they are errors.
Unknown escapes of ASCII letters are reserved
for future use and treated as errors.

Octal escapes are included in a limited form.  If the first digit is a 0, or if
there are three octal digits, it is considered an octal escape. Otherwise, it is
a group reference.  As for string literals, octal escapes are always at most
three digits in length.

.. versionchanged:: 3.3
   The ``'\u'`` and ``'\U'`` escape sequences have been added.

.. versionchanged:: 3.6
   Unknown escapes consisting of ``'\'`` and an ASCII letter now are errors.

.. versionchanged:: 3.8
   The :samp:`'\\N\\{{name}\\}'` escape sequence has been added. As in string literals,
   it expands to the named Unicode character (e.g. ``'\N{EM DASH}'``).


.. _contents-of-module-re:

Module Contents
---------------

The module defines several functions, constants, and an exception. Some of the
functions are simplified versions of the full featured methods for compiled
regular expressions.  Most non-trivial applications always use the compiled
form.


Flags
^^^^^

.. versionchanged:: 3.6
   Flag constants are now instances of :class:`RegexFlag`, which is a subclass of
   :class:`enum.IntFlag`.


.. class:: RegexFlag

   An :class:`enum.IntFlag` class containing the regex options listed below.

   .. versionadded:: 3.11 - added to ``__all__``

.. data:: A
          ASCII

   Make ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\b``, ``\B``, ``\d``, ``\D``, ``\s`` and ``\S``
   perform ASCII-only matching instead of full Unicode matching.  This is only
   meaningful for Unicode (str) patterns, and is ignored for bytes patterns.

   Corresponds to the inline flag ``(?a)``.

   .. note::

      The :py:const:`~re.U` flag still exists for backward compatibility,
      but is redundant in Python 3 since
      matches are Unicode by default for ``str`` patterns,
      and Unicode matching isn't allowed for bytes patterns.
      :py:const:`~re.UNICODE` and the inline flag ``(?u)`` are similarly redundant.


.. data:: DEBUG

   Display debug information about compiled expression.

   No corresponding inline flag.


.. data:: I
          IGNORECASE

   Perform case-insensitive matching;
   expressions like ``[A-Z]`` will also  match lowercase letters.
   Full Unicode matching (such as ``Ü`` matching ``ü``)
   also works unless the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag
   is used to disable non-ASCII matches.
   The current locale does not change the effect of this flag
   unless the :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` flag is also used.

   Corresponds to the inline flag ``(?i)``.

   Note that when the Unicode patterns ``[a-z]`` or ``[A-Z]`` are used in
   combination with the :const:`IGNORECASE` flag, they will match the 52 ASCII
   letters and 4 additional non-ASCII letters: 'İ' (U+0130, Latin capital
   letter I with dot above), 'ı' (U+0131, Latin small letter dotless i),
   'ſ' (U+017F, Latin small letter long s) and 'K' (U+212A, Kelvin sign).
   If the :py:const:`~re.ASCII` flag is used, only letters 'a' to 'z'
   and 'A' to 'Z' are matched.

.. data:: L
          LOCALE

   Make ``\w``, ``\W``, ``\b``, ``\B`` and case-insensitive matching
   dependent on the current locale.
   This flag can be used only with bytes patterns.

   Corresponds to the inline flag ``(?L)``.

   .. warning::

      This flag is discouraged; consider Unicode matching instead.
      The locale mechanism is very unreliable
      as it only handles one "culture" at a time
      and only works with 8-bit locales.
      Unicode matching is enabled by default for Unicode (str) patterns
      and it is able to handle different locales and languages.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` can be used only with bytes patterns
      and is not compatible with :py:const:`~re.ASCII`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Compiled regular expression objects with the :py:const:`~re.LOCALE` flag
      no longer depend on the locale at compile time.
      Only the locale at matching time affects the result of matching.


.. data:: M
          MULTILINE

   When specified, the pattern character ``'^'`` matches at the beginning of the
   string and at the beginning of each line (immediately following each newline);
   and the pattern character ``'$'`` matches at the end of the string and at the
   end of each line (immediately preceding each newline).  By default, ``'^'``
   matches only at the beginning of the string, and ``'$'`` only at the end of the
   string and immediately before the newline (if any) at the end of the string.

   Corresponds to the inline flag ``(?m)``.

.. data:: NOFLAG

   Indicates no flag being applied, the value is ``0``.  This flag may be used
   as a default value for a function keyword argument or as a base value that
   will be conditionally ORed with other flags.  Example of use as a default
   value::

      def myfunc(text, flag=re.NOFLAG):
          return re.match(text, flag)

   .. versionadded:: 3.11

.. data:: S
          DOTALL

   Make the ``'.'`` special character match any character at all, including a
   newline; without this flag, ``'.'`` will match anything *except* a newline.

   Corresponds to the inline flag ``(?s)``.


.. data:: U
          UNICODE

   In Python 3, Unicode characters are matched by default
   for ``str`` patterns.
   This flag is therefore redundant with **no effect**
   and is only kept for backward compatibility.

   See :py:const:`~re.ASCII` to restrict matching to ASCII characters instead.

.. data:: X
          VERBOSE

   .. index:: single: # (hash); in regular expressions

   This flag allows you to write regular expressions that look nicer and are
   more readable by allowing you to visually separate logical sections of the
   pattern and add comments. Whitespace within the pattern is ignored, except
   when in a character class, or when preceded by an unescaped backslash,
   or within tokens like ``*?``, ``(?:`` or ``(?P<...>``. For example, ``(? :``
   and ``* ?`` are not allowed.
   When a line contains a ``#`` that is not in a character class and is not
   preceded by an unescaped backslash, all characters from the leftmost such
   ``#`` through the end of the line are ignored.

   This means that the two following regular expression objects that match a
   decimal number are functionally equal::

      a = re.compile(r"""\d +  # the integral part
                         \.    # the decimal point
                         \d *  # some fractional digits""", re.X)
      b = re.compile(r"\d+\.\d*")

   Corresponds to the inline flag ``(?x)``.


Functions
^^^^^^^^^

.. function:: compile(pattern, flags=0)

   Compile a regular expression pattern into a :ref:`regular expression object
   <re-objects>`, which can be used for matching using its
   :func:`~Pattern.match`, :func:`~Pattern.search` and other methods, described
   below.

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).

   The sequence ::

      prog = re.compile(pattern)
      result = prog.match(string)

   is equivalent to ::

      result = re.match(pattern, string)

   but using :func:`re.compile` and saving the resulting regular expression
   object for reuse is more efficient when the expression will be used several
   times in a single program.

   .. note::

      The compiled versions of the most recent patterns passed to
      :func:`re.compile` and the module-level matching functions are cached, so
      programs that use only a few regular expressions at a time needn't worry
      about compiling regular expressions.


.. function:: search(pattern, string, flags=0)

   Scan through *string* looking for the first location where the regular expression
   *pattern* produces a match, and return a corresponding :class:`~re.Match`. Return
   ``None`` if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that this is
   different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).


.. function:: match(pattern, string, flags=0)

   If zero or more characters at the beginning of *string* match the regular
   expression *pattern*, return a corresponding :class:`~re.Match`.  Return
   ``None`` if the string does not match the pattern; note that this is
   different from a zero-length match.

   Note that even in :const:`MULTILINE` mode, :func:`re.match` will only match
   at the beginning of the string and not at the beginning of each line.

   If you want to locate a match anywhere in *string*, use :func:`search`
   instead (see also :ref:`search-vs-match`).

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).


.. function:: fullmatch(pattern, string, flags=0)

   If the whole *string* matches the regular expression *pattern*, return a
   corresponding :class:`~re.Match`.  Return ``None`` if the string does not match
   the pattern; note that this is different from a zero-length match.

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. function:: split(pattern, string, maxsplit=0, flags=0)

   Split *string* by the occurrences of *pattern*.  If capturing parentheses are
   used in *pattern*, then the text of all groups in the pattern are also returned
   as part of the resulting list. If *maxsplit* is nonzero, at most *maxsplit*
   splits occur, and the remainder of the string is returned as the final element
   of the list. ::

      >>> re.split(r'\W+', 'Words, words, words.')
      ['Words', 'words', 'words', '']
      >>> re.split(r'(\W+)', 'Words, words, words.')
      ['Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.', '']
      >>> re.split(r'\W+', 'Words, words, words.', maxsplit=1)
      ['Words', 'words, words.']
      >>> re.split('[a-f]+', '0a3B9', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
      ['0', '3', '9']

   If there are capturing groups in the separator and it matches at the start of
   the string, the result will start with an empty string.  The same holds for
   the end of the string::

      >>> re.split(r'(\W+)', '...words, words...')
      ['', '...', 'words', ', ', 'words', '...', '']

   That way, separator components are always found at the same relative
   indices within the result list.

   Empty matches for the pattern split the string only when not adjacent
   to a previous empty match.

   .. code:: pycon

      >>> re.split(r'\b', 'Words, words, words.')
      ['', 'Words', ', ', 'words', ', ', 'words', '.']
      >>> re.split(r'\W*', '...words...')
      ['', '', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'd', 's', '', '']
      >>> re.split(r'(\W*)', '...words...')
      ['', '...', '', '', 'w', '', 'o', '', 'r', '', 'd', '', 's', '...', '', '', '']

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.1
      Added the optional flags argument.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Added support of splitting on a pattern that could match an empty string.

   .. deprecated:: 3.13
      Passing *maxsplit* and *flags* as positional arguments is deprecated.
      In future Python versions they will be
      :ref:`keyword-only parameters <keyword-only_parameter>`.


.. function:: findall(pattern, string, flags=0)

   Return all non-overlapping matches of *pattern* in *string*, as a list of
   strings or tuples.  The *string* is scanned left-to-right, and matches
   are returned in the order found.  Empty matches are included in the result.

   The result depends on the number of capturing groups in the pattern.
   If there are no groups, return a list of strings matching the whole
   pattern.  If there is exactly one group, return a list of strings
   matching that group.  If multiple groups are present, return a list
   of tuples of strings matching the groups.  Non-capturing groups do not
   affect the form of the result.

      >>> re.findall(r'\bf[a-z]*', 'which foot or hand fell fastest')
      ['foot', 'fell', 'fastest']
      >>> re.findall(r'(\w+)=(\d+)', 'set width=20 and height=10')
      [('width', '20'), ('height', '10')]

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match.


.. function:: finditer(pattern, string, flags=0)

   Return an :term:`iterator` yielding :class:`~re.Match` objects over
   all non-overlapping matches for the RE *pattern* in *string*.  The *string*
   is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.  Empty
   matches are included in the result.

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Non-empty matches can now start just after a previous empty match.


.. function:: sub(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)

   Return the string obtained by replacing the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences
   of *pattern* in *string* by the replacement *repl*.  If the pattern isn't found,
   *string* is returned unchanged.  *repl* can be a string or a function; if it is
   a string, any backslash escapes in it are processed.  That is, ``\n`` is
   converted to a single newline character, ``\r`` is converted to a carriage return, and
   so forth.  Unknown escapes of ASCII letters are reserved for future use and
   treated as errors.  Other unknown escapes such as ``\&`` are left alone.
   Backreferences, such
   as ``\6``, are replaced with the substring matched by group 6 in the pattern.
   For example::

      >>> re.sub(r'def\s+([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)\s*\(\s*\):',
      ...        r'static PyObject*\npy_\1(void)\n{',
      ...        'def myfunc():')
      'static PyObject*\npy_myfunc(void)\n{'

   If *repl* is a function, it is called for every non-overlapping occurrence of
   *pattern*.  The function takes a single :class:`~re.Match` argument, and returns
   the replacement string.  For example::

      >>> def dashrepl(matchobj):
      ...     if matchobj.group(0) == '-': return ' '
      ...     else: return '-'
      ...
      >>> re.sub('-{1,2}', dashrepl, 'pro----gram-files')
      'pro--gram files'
      >>> re.sub(r'\sAND\s', ' & ', 'Baked Beans And Spam', flags=re.IGNORECASE)
      'Baked Beans & Spam'

   The pattern may be a string or a :class:`~re.Pattern`.

   The optional argument *count* is the maximum number of pattern occurrences to be
   replaced; *count* must be a non-negative integer.  If omitted or zero, all
   occurrences will be replaced. Empty matches for the pattern are replaced only
   when not adjacent to a previous empty match, so ``sub('x*', '-', 'abxd')`` returns
   ``'-a-b--d-'``.

   .. index:: single: \g; in regular expressions

   In string-type *repl* arguments, in addition to the character escapes and
   backreferences described above,
   ``\g<name>`` will use the substring matched by the group named ``name``, as
   defined by the ``(?P<name>...)`` syntax. ``\g<number>`` uses the corresponding
   group number; ``\g<2>`` is therefore equivalent to ``\2``, but isn't ambiguous
   in a replacement such as ``\g<2>0``.  ``\20`` would be interpreted as a
   reference to group 20, not a reference to group 2 followed by the literal
   character ``'0'``.  The backreference ``\g<0>`` substitutes in the entire
   substring matched by the RE.

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.1
      Added the optional flags argument.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Unmatched groups are replaced with an empty string.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.6
      Unknown escapes in *pattern* consisting of ``'\'`` and an ASCII letter
      now are errors.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Unknown escapes in *repl* consisting of ``'\'`` and an ASCII letter
      now are errors.
      Empty matches for the pattern are replaced when adjacent to a previous
      non-empty match.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.12
      Group *id* can only contain ASCII digits.
      In :class:`bytes` replacement strings, group *name* can only contain bytes
      in the ASCII range (``b'\x00'``-``b'\x7f'``).

   .. deprecated:: 3.13
      Passing *count* and *flags* as positional arguments is deprecated.
      In future Python versions they will be
      :ref:`keyword-only parameters <keyword-only_parameter>`.


.. function:: subn(pattern, repl, string, count=0, flags=0)

   Perform the same operation as :func:`sub`, but return a tuple ``(new_string,
   number_of_subs_made)``.

   The expression's behaviour can be modified by specifying a *flags* value.
   Values can be any of the `flags`_ variables, combined using bitwise OR
   (the ``|`` operator).


.. function:: escape(pattern)

   Escape special characters in *pattern*.
   This is useful if you want to match an arbitrary literal string that may
   have regular expression metacharacters in it.  For example::

      >>> print(re.escape('https://www.python.org'))
      https://www\.python\.org

      >>> legal_chars = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits + "!#$%&'*+-.^_`|~:"
      >>> print('[%s]+' % re.escape(legal_chars))
      [abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!\#\$%\&'\*\+\-\.\^_`\|\~:]+

      >>> operators = ['+', '-', '*', '/', '**']
      >>> print('|'.join(map(re.escape, sorted(operators, reverse=True))))
      /|\-|\+|\*\*|\*

   This function must not be used for the replacement string in :func:`sub`
   and :func:`subn`, only backslashes should be escaped.  For example::

      >>> digits_re = r'\d+'
      >>> sample = '/usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 12 warnings'
      >>> print(re.sub(digits_re, digits_re.replace('\\', r'\\'), sample))
      /usr/sbin/sendmail - \d+ errors, \d+ warnings

   .. versionchanged:: 3.3
      The ``'_'`` character is no longer escaped.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.7
      Only characters that can have special meaning in a regular expression
      are escaped. As a result, ``'!'``, ``'"'``, ``'%'``, ``"'"``, ``','``,
      ``'/'``, ``':'``, ``';'``, ``'<'``, ``'='``, ``'>'``, ``'@'``, and
      ``"`"`` are no longer escaped.


.. function:: purge()

   Clear the regular expression cache.


Exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^

.. exception:: PatternError(msg, pattern=None, pos=None)

   Exception raised when a string passed to one of the functions here is not a
   valid regular expression (for example, it might contain unmatched parentheses)
   or when some other error occurs during compilation or matching.  It is never an
   error if a string contains no match for a pattern.  The ``PatternError`` instance has
   the following additional attributes:

   .. attribute:: msg

      The unformatted error message.

   .. attribute:: pattern

      The regular expression pattern.

   .. attribute:: pos

      The index in *pattern* where compilation failed (may be ``None``).

   .. attribute:: lineno

      The line corresponding to *pos* (may be ``None``).

   .. attribute:: colno

      The column corresponding to *pos* (may be ``None``).

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Added additional attributes.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.13
      ``PatternError`` was originally named ``error``; the latter is kept as an alias for
      backward compatibility.

.. _re-objects:

Regular Expression Objects
--------------------------

.. class:: Pattern

   Compiled regular expression object returned by :func:`re.compile`.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      :py:class:`re.Pattern` supports ``[]`` to indicate a Unicode (str) or bytes pattern.
      See :ref:`types-genericalias`.

.. method:: Pattern.search(string[, pos[, endpos]])

   Scan through *string* looking for the first location where this regular
   expression produces a match, and return a corresponding :class:`~re.Match`.
   Return ``None`` if no position in the string matches the pattern; note that
   this is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.

   The optional second parameter *pos* gives an index in the string where the
   search is to start; it defaults to ``0``.  This is not completely equivalent to
   slicing the string; the ``'^'`` pattern character matches at the real beginning
   of the string and at positions just after a newline, but not necessarily at the
   index where the search is to start.

   The optional parameter *endpos* limits how far the string will be searched; it
   will be as if the string is *endpos* characters long, so only the characters
   from *pos* to ``endpos - 1`` will be searched for a match.  If *endpos* is less
   than *pos*, no match will be found; otherwise, if *rx* is a compiled regular
   expression object, ``rx.search(string, 0, 50)`` is equivalent to
   ``rx.search(string[:50], 0)``. ::

      >>> pattern = re.compile("d")
      >>> pattern.search("dog")     # Match at index 0
      <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='d'>
      >>> pattern.search("dog", 1)  # No match; search doesn't include the "d"


.. method:: Pattern.match(string[, pos[, endpos]])

   If zero or more characters at the *beginning* of *string* match this regular
   expression, return a corresponding :class:`~re.Match`. Return ``None`` if the
   string does not match the pattern; note that this is different from a
   zero-length match.

   The optional *pos* and *endpos* parameters have the same meaning as for the
   :meth:`~Pattern.search` method. ::

      >>> pattern = re.compile("o")
      >>> pattern.match("dog")      # No match as "o" is not at the start of "dog".
      >>> pattern.match("dog", 1)   # Match as "o" is the 2nd character of "dog".
      <re.Match object; span=(1, 2), match='o'>

   If you want to locate a match anywhere in *string*, use
   :meth:`~Pattern.search` instead (see also :ref:`search-vs-match`).


.. method:: Pattern.fullmatch(string[, pos[, endpos]])

   If the whole *string* matches this regular expression, return a corresponding
   :class:`~re.Match`.  Return ``None`` if the string does not match the pattern;
   note that this is different from a zero-length match.

   The optional *pos* and *endpos* parameters have the same meaning as for the
   :meth:`~Pattern.search` method. ::

      >>> pattern = re.compile("o[gh]")
      >>> pattern.fullmatch("dog")      # No match as "o" is not at the start of "dog".
      >>> pattern.fullmatch("ogre")     # No match as not the full string matches.
      >>> pattern.fullmatch("doggie", 1, 3)   # Matches within given limits.
      <re.Match object; span=(1, 3), match='og'>

   .. versionadded:: 3.4


.. method:: Pattern.split(string, maxsplit=0)

   Identical to the :func:`split` function, using the compiled pattern.


.. method:: Pattern.findall(string[, pos[, endpos]])

   Similar to the :func:`findall` function, using the compiled pattern, but
   also accepts optional *pos* and *endpos* parameters that limit the search
   region like for :meth:`search`.


.. method:: Pattern.finditer(string[, pos[, endpos]])

   Similar to the :func:`finditer` function, using the compiled pattern, but
   also accepts optional *pos* and *endpos* parameters that limit the search
   region like for :meth:`search`.


.. method:: Pattern.sub(repl, string, count=0)

   Identical to the :func:`sub` function, using the compiled pattern.


.. method:: Pattern.subn(repl, string, count=0)

   Identical to the :func:`subn` function, using the compiled pattern.


.. attribute:: Pattern.flags

   The regex matching flags.  This is a combination of the flags given to
   :func:`.compile`, any ``(?...)`` inline flags in the pattern, and implicit
   flags such as :py:const:`~re.UNICODE` if the pattern is a Unicode string.


.. attribute:: Pattern.groups

   The number of capturing groups in the pattern.


.. attribute:: Pattern.groupindex

   A dictionary mapping any symbolic group names defined by ``(?P<id>)`` to group
   numbers.  The dictionary is empty if no symbolic groups were used in the
   pattern.


.. attribute:: Pattern.pattern

   The pattern string from which the pattern object was compiled.


.. versionchanged:: 3.7
   Added support of :func:`copy.copy` and :func:`copy.deepcopy`.  Compiled
   regular expression objects are considered atomic.


.. _match-objects:

Match Objects
-------------

Match objects always have a boolean value of ``True``.
Since :meth:`~Pattern.match` and :meth:`~Pattern.search` return ``None``
when there is no match, you can test whether there was a match with a simple
``if`` statement::

   match = re.search(pattern, string)
   if match:
       process(match)

.. class:: Match

   Match object returned by successful ``match``\ es and ``search``\ es.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.9
      :py:class:`re.Match` supports ``[]`` to indicate a Unicode (str) or bytes match.
      See :ref:`types-genericalias`.

.. method:: Match.expand(template)

   Return the string obtained by doing backslash substitution on the template
   string *template*, as done by the :meth:`~Pattern.sub` method.
   Escapes such as ``\n`` are converted to the appropriate characters,
   and numeric backreferences (``\1``, ``\2``) and named backreferences
   (``\g<1>``, ``\g<name>``) are replaced by the contents of the
   corresponding group. The backreference ``\g<0>`` will be
   replaced by the entire match.

   .. versionchanged:: 3.5
      Unmatched groups are replaced with an empty string.

.. method:: Match.group([group1, ...])

   Returns one or more subgroups of the match.  If there is a single argument, the
   result is a single string; if there are multiple arguments, the result is a
   tuple with one item per argument. Without arguments, *group1* defaults to zero
   (the whole match is returned). If a *groupN* argument is zero, the corresponding
   return value is the entire matching string; if it is in the inclusive range
   [1..99], it is the string matching the corresponding parenthesized group.  If a
   group number is negative or larger than the number of groups defined in the
   pattern, an :exc:`IndexError` exception is raised. If a group is contained in a
   part of the pattern that did not match, the corresponding result is ``None``.
   If a group is contained in a part of the pattern that matched multiple times,
   the last match is returned. ::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(\w+) (\w+)", "Isaac Newton, physicist")
      >>> m.group(0)       # The entire match
      'Isaac Newton'
      >>> m.group(1)       # The first parenthesized subgroup.
      'Isaac'
      >>> m.group(2)       # The second parenthesized subgroup.
      'Newton'
      >>> m.group(1, 2)    # Multiple arguments give us a tuple.
      ('Isaac', 'Newton')

   If the regular expression uses the ``(?P<name>...)`` syntax, the *groupN*
   arguments may also be strings identifying groups by their group name.  If a
   string argument is not used as a group name in the pattern, an :exc:`IndexError`
   exception is raised.

   A moderately complicated example::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(?P<first_name>\w+) (?P<last_name>\w+)", "Malcolm Reynolds")
      >>> m.group('first_name')
      'Malcolm'
      >>> m.group('last_name')
      'Reynolds'

   Named groups can also be referred to by their index::

      >>> m.group(1)
      'Malcolm'
      >>> m.group(2)
      'Reynolds'

   If a group matches multiple times, only the last match is accessible::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(..)+", "a1b2c3")  # Matches 3 times.
      >>> m.group(1)                        # Returns only the last match.
      'c3'


.. method:: Match.__getitem__(g)

   This is identical to ``m.group(g)``.  This allows easier access to
   an individual group from a match::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(\w+) (\w+)", "Isaac Newton, physicist")
      >>> m[0]       # The entire match
      'Isaac Newton'
      >>> m[1]       # The first parenthesized subgroup.
      'Isaac'
      >>> m[2]       # The second parenthesized subgroup.
      'Newton'

   Named groups are supported as well::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(?P<first_name>\w+) (?P<last_name>\w+)", "Isaac Newton")
      >>> m['first_name']
      'Isaac'
      >>> m['last_name']
      'Newton'

   .. versionadded:: 3.6


.. method:: Match.groups(default=None)

   Return a tuple containing all the subgroups of the match, from 1 up to however
   many groups are in the pattern.  The *default* argument is used for groups that
   did not participate in the match; it defaults to ``None``.

   For example::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(\d+)\.(\d+)", "24.1632")
      >>> m.groups()
      ('24', '1632')

   If we make the decimal place and everything after it optional, not all groups
   might participate in the match.  These groups will default to ``None`` unless
   the *default* argument is given::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(\d+)\.?(\d+)?", "24")
      >>> m.groups()      # Second group defaults to None.
      ('24', None)
      >>> m.groups('0')   # Now, the second group defaults to '0'.
      ('24', '0')


.. method:: Match.groupdict(default=None)

   Return a dictionary containing all the *named* subgroups of the match, keyed by
   the subgroup name.  The *default* argument is used for groups that did not
   participate in the match; it defaults to ``None``.  For example::

      >>> m = re.match(r"(?P<first_name>\w+) (?P<last_name>\w+)", "Malcolm Reynolds")
      >>> m.groupdict()
      {'first_name': 'Malcolm', 'last_name': 'Reynolds'}


.. method:: Match.start([group])
            Match.end([group])

   Return the indices of the start and end of the substring matched by *group*;
   *group* defaults to zero (meaning the whole matched substring). Return ``-1`` if
   *group* exists but did not contribute to the match.  For a match object *m*, and
   a group *g* that did contribute to the match, the substring matched by group *g*
   (equivalent to ``m.group(g)``) is ::

      m.string[m.start(g):m.end(g)]

   Note that ``m.start(group)`` will equal ``m.end(group)`` if *group* matched a
   null string.  For example, after ``m = re.search('b(c?)', 'cba')``,
   ``m.start(0)`` is 1, ``m.end(0)`` is 2, ``m.start(1)`` and ``m.end(1)`` are both
   2, and ``m.start(2)`` raises an :exc:`IndexError` exception.

   An example that will remove *remove_this* from email addresses::

      >>> email = "tony@tiremove_thisger.net"
      >>> m = re.search("remove_this", email)
      >>> email[:m.start()] + email[m.end():]
      'tony@tiger.net'


.. method:: Match.span([group])

   For a match *m*, return the 2-tuple ``(m.start(group), m.end(group))``. Note
   that if *group* did not contribute to the match, this is ``(-1, -1)``.
   *group* defaults to zero, the entire match.


.. attribute:: Match.pos

   The value of *pos* which was passed to the :meth:`~Pattern.search` or
   :meth:`~Pattern.match` method of a :ref:`regex object <re-objects>`.  This is
   the index into the string at which the RE engine started looking for a match.


.. attribute:: Match.endpos

   The value of *endpos* which was passed to the :meth:`~Pattern.search` or
   :meth:`~Pattern.match` method of a :ref:`regex object <re-objects>`.  This is
   the index into the string beyond which the RE engine will not go.


.. attribute:: Match.lastindex

   The integer index of the last matched capturing group, or ``None`` if no group
   was matched at all. For example, the expressions ``(a)b``, ``((a)(b))``, and
   ``((ab))`` will have ``lastindex == 1`` if applied to the string ``'ab'``, while
   the expression ``(a)(b)`` will have ``lastindex == 2``, if applied to the same
   string.


.. attribute:: Match.lastgroup

   The name of the last matched capturing group, or ``None`` if the group didn't
   have a name, or if no group was matched at all.


.. attribute:: Match.re

   The :ref:`regular expression object <re-objects>` whose :meth:`~Pattern.match` or
   :meth:`~Pattern.search` method produced this match instance.


.. attribute:: Match.string

   The string passed to :meth:`~Pattern.match` or :meth:`~Pattern.search`.


.. versionchanged:: 3.7
   Added support of :func:`copy.copy` and :func:`copy.deepcopy`.  Match objects
   are considered atomic.


.. _re-examples:

Regular Expression Examples
---------------------------


Checking for a Pair
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this example, we'll use the following helper function to display match
objects a little more gracefully::

   def displaymatch(match):
       if match is None:
           return None
       return '<Match: %r, groups=%r>' % (match.group(), match.groups())

Suppose you are writing a poker program where a player's hand is represented as
a 5-character string with each character representing a card, "a" for ace, "k"
for king, "q" for queen, "j" for jack, "t" for 10, and "2" through "9"
representing the card with that value.

To see if a given string is a valid hand, one could do the following::

   >>> valid = re.compile(r"^[a2-9tjqk]{5}$")
   >>> displaymatch(valid.match("akt5q"))  # Valid.
   "<Match: 'akt5q', groups=()>"
   >>> displaymatch(valid.match("akt5e"))  # Invalid.
   >>> displaymatch(valid.match("akt"))    # Invalid.
   >>> displaymatch(valid.match("727ak"))  # Valid.
   "<Match: '727ak', groups=()>"

That last hand, ``"727ak"``, contained a pair, or two of the same valued cards.
To match this with a regular expression, one could use backreferences as such::

   >>> pair = re.compile(r".*(.).*\1")
   >>> displaymatch(pair.match("717ak"))     # Pair of 7s.
   "<Match: '717', groups=('7',)>"
   >>> displaymatch(pair.match("718ak"))     # No pairs.
   >>> displaymatch(pair.match("354aa"))     # Pair of aces.
   "<Match: '354aa', groups=('a',)>"

To find out what card the pair consists of, one could use the
:meth:`~Match.group` method of the match object in the following manner::

   >>> pair = re.compile(r".*(.).*\1")
   >>> pair.match("717ak").group(1)
   '7'

   # Error because re.match() returns None, which doesn't have a group() method:
   >>> pair.match("718ak").group(1)
   Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<pyshell#23>", line 1, in <module>
       re.match(r".*(.).*\1", "718ak").group(1)
   AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'group'

   >>> pair.match("354aa").group(1)
   'a'


Simulating scanf()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. index:: single: scanf (C function)

Python does not currently have an equivalent to :c:func:`!scanf`.  Regular
expressions are generally more powerful, though also more verbose, than
:c:func:`!scanf` format strings.  The table below offers some more-or-less
equivalent mappings between :c:func:`!scanf` format tokens and regular
expressions.

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| :c:func:`!scanf` Token         | Regular Expression                          |
+================================+=============================================+
| ``%c``                         | ``.``                                       |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%5c``                        | ``.{5}``                                    |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%d``                         | ``[-+]?\d+``                                |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%e``, ``%E``, ``%f``, ``%g`` | ``[-+]?(\d+(\.\d*)?|\.\d+)([eE][-+]?\d+)?`` |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%i``                         | ``[-+]?(0[xX][\dA-Fa-f]+|0[0-7]*|\d+)``     |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%o``                         | ``[-+]?[0-7]+``                             |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%s``                         | ``\S+``                                     |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%u``                         | ``\d+``                                     |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| ``%x``, ``%X``                 | ``[-+]?(0[xX])?[\dA-Fa-f]+``                |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

To extract the filename and numbers from a string like ::

   /usr/sbin/sendmail - 0 errors, 4 warnings

you would use a :c:func:`!scanf` format like ::

   %s - %d errors, %d warnings

The equivalent regular expression would be ::

   (\S+) - (\d+) errors, (\d+) warnings


.. _search-vs-match:

search() vs. match()
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. sectionauthor:: Fred L. Drake, Jr. <fdrake@acm.org>

Python offers different primitive operations based on regular expressions:

+ :func:`re.match` checks for a match only at the beginning of the string
+ :func:`re.search` checks for a match anywhere in the string
  (this is what Perl does by default)
+ :func:`re.fullmatch` checks for entire string to be a match


For example::

   >>> re.match("c", "abcdef")    # No match
   >>> re.search("c", "abcdef")   # Match
   <re.Match object; span=(2, 3), match='c'>
   >>> re.fullmatch("p.*n", "python") # Match
   <re.Match object; span=(0, 6), match='python'>
   >>> re.fullmatch("r.*n", "python") # No match

Regular expressions beginning with ``'^'`` can be used with :func:`search` to
restrict the match at the beginning of the string::

   >>> re.match("c", "abcdef")    # No match
   >>> re.search("^c", "abcdef")  # No match
   >>> re.search("^a", "abcdef")  # Match
   <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='a'>

Note however that in :const:`MULTILINE` mode :func:`match` only matches at the
beginning of the string, whereas using :func:`search` with a regular expression
beginning with ``'^'`` will match at the beginning of each line. ::

   >>> re.match("X", "A\nB\nX", re.MULTILINE)  # No match
   >>> re.search("^X", "A\nB\nX", re.MULTILINE)  # Match
   <re.Match object; span=(4, 5), match='X'>


Making a Phonebook
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`split` splits a string into a list delimited by the passed pattern.  The
method is invaluable for converting textual data into data structures that can be
easily read and modified by Python as demonstrated in the following example that
creates a phonebook.

First, here is the input.  Normally it may come from a file, here we are using
triple-quoted string syntax

.. doctest::

   >>> text = """Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street
   ...
   ... Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue
   ... Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way
   ...
   ...
   ... Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place"""

The entries are separated by one or more newlines. Now we convert the string
into a list with each nonempty line having its own entry:

.. doctest::
   :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

   >>> entries = re.split("\n+", text)
   >>> entries
   ['Ross McFluff: 834.345.1254 155 Elm Street',
   'Ronald Heathmore: 892.345.3428 436 Finley Avenue',
   'Frank Burger: 925.541.7625 662 South Dogwood Way',
   'Heather Albrecht: 548.326.4584 919 Park Place']

Finally, split each entry into a list with first name, last name, telephone
number, and address.  We use the ``maxsplit`` parameter of :func:`split`
because the address has spaces, our splitting pattern, in it:

.. doctest::
   :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

   >>> [re.split(":? ", entry, maxsplit=3) for entry in entries]
   [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155 Elm Street'],
   ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436 Finley Avenue'],
   ['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662 South Dogwood Way'],
   ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919 Park Place']]

The ``:?`` pattern matches the colon after the last name, so that it does not
occur in the result list.  With a ``maxsplit`` of ``4``, we could separate the
house number from the street name:

.. doctest::
   :options: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

   >>> [re.split(":? ", entry, maxsplit=4) for entry in entries]
   [['Ross', 'McFluff', '834.345.1254', '155', 'Elm Street'],
   ['Ronald', 'Heathmore', '892.345.3428', '436', 'Finley Avenue'],
   ['Frank', 'Burger', '925.541.7625', '662', 'South Dogwood Way'],
   ['Heather', 'Albrecht', '548.326.4584', '919', 'Park Place']]


Text Munging
^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`sub` replaces every occurrence of a pattern with a string or the
result of a function.  This example demonstrates using :func:`sub` with
a function to "munge" text, or randomize the order of all the characters
in each word of a sentence except for the first and last characters::

   >>> def repl(m):
   ...     inner_word = list(m.group(2))
   ...     random.shuffle(inner_word)
   ...     return m.group(1) + "".join(inner_word) + m.group(3)
   ...
   >>> text = "Professor Abdolmalek, please report your absences promptly."
   >>> re.sub(r"(\w)(\w+)(\w)", repl, text)
   'Poefsrosr Aealmlobdk, pslaee reorpt your abnseces plmrptoy.'
   >>> re.sub(r"(\w)(\w+)(\w)", repl, text)
   'Pofsroser Aodlambelk, plasee reoprt yuor asnebces potlmrpy.'


Finding all Adverbs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:func:`findall` matches *all* occurrences of a pattern, not just the first
one as :func:`search` does.  For example, if a writer wanted to
find all of the adverbs in some text, they might use :func:`findall` in
the following manner::

   >>> text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police."
   >>> re.findall(r"\w+ly\b", text)
   ['carefully', 'quickly']


Finding all Adverbs and their Positions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If one wants more information about all matches of a pattern than the matched
text, :func:`finditer` is useful as it provides :class:`~re.Match` objects
instead of strings.  Continuing with the previous example, if a writer wanted
to find all of the adverbs *and their positions* in some text, they would use
:func:`finditer` in the following manner::

   >>> text = "He was carefully disguised but captured quickly by police."
   >>> for m in re.finditer(r"\w+ly\b", text):
   ...     print('%02d-%02d: %s' % (m.start(), m.end(), m.group(0)))
   07-16: carefully
   40-47: quickly


Raw String Notation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Raw string notation (``r"text"``) keeps regular expressions sane.  Without it,
every backslash (``'\'``) in a regular expression would have to be prefixed with
another one to escape it.  For example, the two following lines of code are
functionally identical::

   >>> re.match(r"\W(.)\1\W", " ff ")
   <re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match=' ff '>
   >>> re.match("\\W(.)\\1\\W", " ff ")
   <re.Match object; span=(0, 4), match=' ff '>

When one wants to match a literal backslash, it must be escaped in the regular
expression.  With raw string notation, this means ``r"\\"``.  Without raw string
notation, one must use ``"\\\\"``, making the following lines of code
functionally identical::

   >>> re.match(r"\\", r"\\")
   <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='\\'>
   >>> re.match("\\\\", r"\\")
   <re.Match object; span=(0, 1), match='\\'>


Writing a Tokenizer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A `tokenizer or scanner <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis>`_
analyzes a string to categorize groups of characters.  This is a useful first
step in writing a compiler or interpreter.

The text categories are specified with regular expressions.  The technique is
to combine those into a single master regular expression and to loop over
successive matches::

    from typing import NamedTuple
    import re

    class Token(NamedTuple):
        type: str
        value: str
        line: int
        column: int

    def tokenize(code):
        keywords = {'IF', 'THEN', 'ENDIF', 'FOR', 'NEXT', 'GOSUB', 'RETURN'}
        token_specification = [
            ('NUMBER',   r'\d+(\.\d*)?'),  # Integer or decimal number
            ('ASSIGN',   r':='),           # Assignment operator
            ('END',      r';'),            # Statement terminator
            ('ID',       r'[A-Za-z]+'),    # Identifiers
            ('OP',       r'[+\-*/]'),      # Arithmetic operators
            ('NEWLINE',  r'\n'),           # Line endings
            ('SKIP',     r'[ \t]+'),       # Skip over spaces and tabs
            ('MISMATCH', r'.'),            # Any other character
        ]
        tok_regex = '|'.join('(?P<%s>%s)' % pair for pair in token_specification)
        line_num = 1
        line_start = 0
        for mo in re.finditer(tok_regex, code):
            kind = mo.lastgroup
            value = mo.group()
            column = mo.start() - line_start
            if kind == 'NUMBER':
                value = float(value) if '.' in value else int(value)
            elif kind == 'ID' and value in keywords:
                kind = value
            elif kind == 'NEWLINE':
                line_start = mo.end()
                line_num += 1
                continue
            elif kind == 'SKIP':
                continue
            elif kind == 'MISMATCH':
                raise RuntimeError(f'{value!r} unexpected on line {line_num}')
            yield Token(kind, value, line_num, column)

    statements = '''
        IF quantity THEN
            total := total + price * quantity;
            tax := price * 0.05;
        ENDIF;
    '''

    for token in tokenize(statements):
        print(token)

The tokenizer produces the following output::

    Token(type='IF', value='IF', line=2, column=4)
    Token(type='ID', value='quantity', line=2, column=7)
    Token(type='THEN', value='THEN', line=2, column=16)
    Token(type='ID', value='total', line=3, column=8)
    Token(type='ASSIGN', value=':=', line=3, column=14)
    Token(type='ID', value='total', line=3, column=17)
    Token(type='OP', value='+', line=3, column=23)
    Token(type='ID', value='price', line=3, column=25)
    Token(type='OP', value='*', line=3, column=31)
    Token(type='ID', value='quantity', line=3, column=33)
    Token(type='END', value=';', line=3, column=41)
    Token(type='ID', value='tax', line=4, column=8)
    Token(type='ASSIGN', value=':=', line=4, column=12)
    Token(type='ID', value='price', line=4, column=15)
    Token(type='OP', value='*', line=4, column=21)
    Token(type='NUMBER', value=0.05, line=4, column=23)
    Token(type='END', value=';', line=4, column=27)
    Token(type='ENDIF', value='ENDIF', line=5, column=4)
    Token(type='END', value=';', line=5, column=9)
