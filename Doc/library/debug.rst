Debugging and profiling
***********************

These libraries help you with Python development: the debugger enables you to
step through code, analyze stack frames and set breakpoints etc., and the
profilers run code and give you a detailed breakdown of execution times,
allowing you to identify bottlenecks in your programs. Auditing events
provide visibility into runtime behaviors that would otherwise require
intrusive debugging or patching.
