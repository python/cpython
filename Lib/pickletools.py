'''"Executable documentation" for the pickle module.

Extensive comments about the pickle protocols and pickle-machine opcodes
can be found here.  Some functions meant for external use:

genops(pickle)
   Generate all the opcodes in a pickle, as (opcode, arg, position) triples.

dis(pickle, out=None, memo=None, indentlevel=4)
   Print a symbolic disassembly of a pickle.

# Other ideas:
#
# - A pickle verifier:  read a pickle and check it exhaustively for
#   well-formedness.  dis() does a lot of this already.
#
# - A protocol identifier:  examine a pickle and return its protocol number
#   (== the highest .proto attr value among all the opcodes in the pickle).
#   dis() already prints this info at the end.
#
# - A pickle optimizer:  for example, tuple-building code is sometimes more
#   elaborate than necessary, catering for the possibility that the tuple
#   is recursive.  Or lots of times a PUT is generated that's never accessed
#   by a later GET.


# "A pickle" is a program for a virtual pickle machine (PM, but more accurately
# called an unpickling machine).  It's a sequence of opcodes, interpreted by the
# PM, building an arbitrarily complex Python object.
#
# For the most part, the PM is very simple:  there are no looping, testing, or
# conditional instructions, no arithmetic and no function calls.  Opcodes are
# executed once each, from first to last, until a STOP opcode is reached.
#
# The PM has two data areas, "the stack" and "the memo".
#
# Many opcodes push Python objects onto the stack; e.g., INT pushes a Python
# integer object on the stack, whose value is gotten from a decimal string
# literal immediately following the INT opcode in the pickle bytestream.  Other
# opcodes take Python objects off the stack.  The result of unpickling is
# whatever object is left on the stack when the final STOP opcode is executed.
#
# The memo is simply an array of objects, or it can be implemented as a dict
# mapping little integers to objects.  The memo serves as the PM's "long term
# memory", and the little integers indexing the memo are akin to variable
# names.  Some opcodes pop a stack object into the memo at a given index,
# and others push a memo object at a given index onto the stack again.
#
# At heart, that's all the PM has.  Subtleties arise for these reasons:
#
# + Object identity.  Objects can be arbitrarily complex, and subobjects
#   may be shared (for example, the list [a, a] refers to the same object a
#   twice).  It can be vital that unpickling recreate an isomorphic object
#   graph, faithfully reproducing sharing.
#
# + Recursive objects.  For example, after "L = []; L.append(L)", L is a
#   list, and L[0] is the same list.  This is related to the object identity
#   point, and some sequences of pickle opcodes are subtle in order to
#   get the right result in all cases.
#
# + Things pickle doesn't know everything about.  Examples of things pickle
#   does know everything about are Python's builtin scalar and container
#   types, like ints and tuples.  They generally have opcodes dedicated to
#   them.  For things like module references and instances of user-defined
#   classes, pickle's knowledge is limited.  Historically, many enhancements
#   have been made to the pickle protocol in order to do a better (faster,
#   and/or more compact) job on those.
#
# + Backward compatibility and micro-optimization.  As explained below,
#   pickle opcodes never go away, not even when better ways to do a thing
#   get invented.  The repertoire of the PM just keeps growing over time.
#   For example, protocol 0 had two opcodes for building Python integers (INT
#   and LONG), protocol 1 added three more for more-efficient pickling of short
#   integers, and protocol 2 added two more for more-efficient pickling of
#   long integers (before protocol 2, the only ways to pickle a Python long
#   took time quadratic in the number of digits, for both pickling and
#   unpickling).  "Opcode bloat" isn't so much a subtlety as a source of
#   wearying complication.
#
#
# Pickle protocols:
#
# For compatibility, the meaning of a pickle opcode never changes.  Instead new
# pickle opcodes get added, and each version's unpickler can handle all the
# pickle opcodes in all protocol versions to date.  So old pickles continue to
# be readable forever.  The pickler can generally be told to restrict itself to
# the subset of opcodes available under previous protocol versions too, so that
# users can create pickles under the current version readable by older
# versions.  However, a pickle does not contain its version number embedded
# within it.  If an older unpickler tries to read a pickle using a later
# protocol, the result is most likely an exception due to seeing an unknown (in
# the older unpickler) opcode.
#
# The original pickle used what's now called "protocol 0", and what was called
# "text mode" before Python 2.3.  The entire pickle bytestream is made up of
# printable 7-bit ASCII characters, plus the newline character, in protocol 0.
# That's why it was called text mode.  Protocol 0 is small and elegant, but
# sometimes painfully inefficient.
#
# The second major set of additions is now called "protocol 1", and was called
# "binary mode" before Python 2.3.  This added many opcodes with arguments
# consisting of arbitrary bytes, including NUL bytes and unprintable "high bit"
# bytes.  Binary mode pickles can be substantially smaller than equivalent
# text mode pickles, and sometimes faster too; e.g., BININT represents a 4-byte
# int as 4 bytes following the opcode, which is cheaper to unpickle than the
# (perhaps) 11-character decimal string attached to INT.  Protocol 1 also added
# a number of opcodes that operate on many stack elements at once (like APPENDS
# and SETITEMS), and "shortcut" opcodes (like EMPTY_DICT and EMPTY_TUPLE).
#
# The third major set of additions came in Python 2.3, and is called "protocol
# 2".  This added:
#
# - A better way to pickle instances of new-style classes (NEWOBJ).
#
# - A way for a pickle to identify its protocol (PROTO).
#
# - Time- and space- efficient pickling of long ints (LONG{1,4}).
#
# - Shortcuts for small tuples (TUPLE{1,2,3}}.
#
# - Dedicated opcodes for bools (NEWTRUE, NEWFALSE).
#
# - The "extension registry", a vector of popular objects that can be pushed
#   efficiently by index (EXT{1,2,4}).  This is akin to the memo and GET, but
#   the registry contents are predefined (there's nothing akin to the memo's
#   PUT).
#
# Another independent change with Python 2.3 is the abandonment of any
# pretense that it might be safe to load pickles received from untrusted
# parties -- no sufficient security analysis has been done to guarantee
# this and there isn't a use case that warrants the expense of such an
# analysis.
#
# To this end, all tests for __safe_for_unpickling__ or for
# copyreg.safe_constructors are removed from the unpickling code.
# References to these variables in the descriptions below are to be seen
# as describing unpickling in Python 2.2 and before.


# Meta-rule:  Descriptions are stored in instances of descriptor objects,
# with plain constructors.  No meta-language is defined from which
# descriptors could be constructed.  If you want, e.g., XML, write a little
# program to generate XML from the objects.

      The argument is a newline-terminated decimal literal string.

      The intent may have been that this always fit in a short Python int,
      but INT can be generated in pickles written on a 64-bit box that
      require a Python long on a 32-bit box.  The difference between this
      and LONG then is that INT skips a trailing 'L', and produces a short
      int whenever possible.

      Another difference is due to that, when bool was introduced as a
      distinct type in 2.3, builtin names True and False were also added to
      2.2.2, mapping to ints 1 and 0.  For compatibility in both directions,
      True gets pickled as INT + "I01\\n", and False as INT + "I00\\n".
      Leading zeroes are never produced for a genuine integer.  The 2.3
      (and later) unpicklers special-case these and return bool instead;
      earlier unpicklers ignore the leading "0" and return the int.

      This is the protocol 0 version of protocol 1's OBJ opcode.
      INST is followed by two newline-terminated strings, giving a
      module and class name, just as for the GLOBAL opcode (and see
      GLOBAL for more details about that).  self.find_class(module, name)
      is used to get a class object.

      In addition, all the objects on the stack following the topmost
      markobject are gathered into a tuple and popped (along with the
      topmost markobject), just as for the TUPLE opcode.

      Now it gets complicated.  If all of these are true:

        + The argtuple is empty (markobject was at the top of the stack
          at the start).

        + The class object does not have a __getinitargs__ attribute.

      then we want to create an old-style class instance without invoking
      its __init__() method (pickle has waffled on this over the years; not
      calling __init__() is current wisdom).  In this case, an instance of
      an old-style dummy class is created, and then we try to rebind its
      __class__ attribute to the desired class object.  If this succeeds,
      the new instance object is pushed on the stack, and we're done.

      Else (the argtuple is not empty, it's not an old-style class object,
      or the class object does have a __getinitargs__ attribute), the code
      first insists that the class object have a __safe_for_unpickling__
      attribute.  Unlike as for the __safe_for_unpickling__ check in REDUCE,
      it doesn't matter whether this attribute has a true or false value, it
      only matters whether it exists (XXX this is a bug).  If
      __safe_for_unpickling__ doesn't exist, UnpicklingError is raised.

      Else (the class object does have a __safe_for_unpickling__ attr),
      the class object obtained from INST's arguments is applied to the
      argtuple obtained from the stack, and the resulting instance object
      is pushed on the stack.

      NOTE:  checks for __safe_for_unpickling__ went away in Python 2.3.

      This is the protocol 1 version of protocol 0's INST opcode, and is
      very much like it.  The major difference is that the class object
      is taken off the stack, allowing it to be retrieved from the memo
      repeatedly if several instances of the same class are created.  This
      can be much more efficient (in both time and space) than repeatedly
      embedding the module and class names in INST opcodes.

      Unlike INST, OBJ takes no arguments from the opcode stream.  Instead
      the class object is taken off the stack, immediately above the
      topmost markobject:

      Stack before: ... markobject classobject stackslice

      a bug).  See INST for the gory details.

# A symbolic pickle disassembler.

def dis(pickle, out=None, memo=None, indentlevel=4, annotate=0):
    """Produce a symbolic disassembly of a pickle.

    'pickle' is a file-like object, or string, containing a (at least one)
    pickle.  The pickle is disassembled from the current position, through
    the first STOP opcode encountered.

    Optional arg 'out' is a file-like object to which the disassembly is
    printed.  It defaults to sys.stdout.

    Optional arg 'memo' is a Python dict, used as the pickle's memo.  It
    may be mutated by dis(), if the pickle contains PUT or BINPUT opcodes.
    Passing the same memo object to another dis() call then allows disassembly
    to proceed across multiple pickles that were all created by the same
    pickler with the same memo.  Ordinarily you don't need to worry about this.

    Optional arg 'indentlevel' is the number of blanks by which to indent
    a new MARK level.  It defaults to 4.

    Optional arg 'annotate' if nonzero instructs dis() to add short
    description of the opcode on each line of disassembled output.
    The value given to 'annotate' must be an integer and is used as a
    hint for the column where annotation should start.  The default
    value is 0, meaning no annotations.

    In addition to printing the disassembly, some sanity checks are made:

    + All embedded opcode arguments "make sense".

    + Explicit and implicit pop operations have enough items on the stack.

    + When an opcode implicitly refers to a markobject, a markobject is
      actually on the stack.

    + A memo entry isn't referenced before it's defined.

    + The markobject isn't stored in the memo.
    """
