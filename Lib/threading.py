# A barrier class.  Inspired in part by the pthread_barrier_* api and
# the CyclicBarrier class from Java.  See
# http://sourceware.org/pthreads-win32/manual/pthread_barrier_init.html and
# http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/
#        CyclicBarrier.html
# for information.
# We maintain two main states, 'filling' and 'draining' enabling the barrier
# to be cyclic.  Threads are not allowed into it until it has fully drained
# since the previous cycle.  In addition, a 'resetting' state exists which is
# similar to 'draining' except that threads leave with a BrokenBarrierError,
# and a 'broken' state in which all threads get the exception.
