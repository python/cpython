# Note that using the new PEP 8 compliant names facilitates substitution

# to be cyclic.  Threads are not allowed into it until it has fully drained
# since the previous cycle.  In addition, a 'resetting' state exists which is
# similar to 'draining' except that threads leave with a BrokenBarrierError,
# and a 'broken' state in which all threads get the exception.
