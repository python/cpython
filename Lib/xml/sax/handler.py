#============================================================================

# ===== ERRORHANDLER =====

class ErrorHandler:
    """Basic interface for SAX error handlers.

    If you create an object that implements this interface, then
    register the object with your XMLReader, the parser will call the
    methods in your object to report all warnings and errors. There
    are three levels of errors available: warnings, (possibly)
    recoverable errors, and unrecoverable errors. All methods take a
    SAXParseException as the only parameter."""

    def error(self, exception):
        "Handle a recoverable error."
        raise exception

    def fatalError(self, exception):
        "Handle a non-recoverable error."
        raise exception

    def warning(self, exception):
        "Handle a warning."
        print(exception)


# ===== CONTENTHANDLER =====

class ContentHandler:
    """Interface for receiving logical document content events.

    This is the main callback interface in SAX, and the one most
    important to applications. The order of events in this interface
    mirrors the order of the information in the document."""

    def __init__(self):
        self._locator = None

    def setDocumentLocator(self, locator):

        locating the origin of document events.

        SAX parsers are strongly encouraged (though not absolutely
        required) to supply a locator: if it does so, it must supply
        the locator to the application by invoking this method before
        invoking any of the other methods in the DocumentHandler
        interface.

        The locator allows the application to determine the end
        position of any document-related event, even if the parser is
        not reporting an error. Typically, the application will use
        this information for reporting its own errors (such as
        character content that does not match an application's
        business rules). The information returned by the locator is
        probably not sufficient for use with a search engine.

        Note that the locator will return correct information only
        during the invocation of the events in this interface. The
        application should not attempt to use it at any other time."""

        be the last method invoked during the parse. The parser shall
        not invoke this method until it has either abandoned parsing
        (because of an unrecoverable error) or reached the end of
        input."""

        """Begin the scope of a prefix-URI Namespace mapping.

        The information from this event is not necessary for normal
        Namespace processing: the SAX XML reader will automatically
        replace prefixes for element and attribute names when the
        http://xml.org/sax/features/namespaces feature is true (the
        default).

        There are cases, however, when applications need to use
        prefixes in character data or in attribute values, where they
        cannot safely be expanded automatically; the
        start/endPrefixMapping event supplies the information to the
        application to expand prefixes in those contexts itself, if
        necessary.

        Note that start/endPrefixMapping events are not guaranteed to
        be properly nested relative to each-other: all
        startPrefixMapping events will occur before the corresponding
        startElement event, and all endPrefixMapping events will occur
        after the corresponding endElement event, but their order is
        not guaranteed."""

        holds an instance of the Attributes class containing the
