    self.cur is always a tuple.  Each such tuple corresponds to a stack
    frame that is currently active (self.cur[-2]).  The following are the
    definitions of its members.  We use this external "parallel stack" to
    avoid contaminating the program that we are profiling. (old profiler
    used to write into the frames local dictionary!!) Derived classes
    can change the definition of some entries, as long as they leave
    [-2:] intact (frame and previous tuple).  In case an internal error is
    detected, the -3 element is used as the function name.

    [ 0] = Time that needs to be charged to the parent frame's function.
           It is used so that a function call will not have to access the
           timing data for the parent frame.
    [ 1] = Total time spent in this frame's function, excluding time in
           subfunctions (this latter is tallied in cur[2]).
    [ 2] = Total time spent in subfunctions, excluding time executing the
           frame's function (this latter is tallied in cur[1]).
    [-3] = Name of the function that corresponds to this frame.
    [-2] = Actual frame that we correspond to (used to sync exception handling).
    [-1] = Our parent 6-tuple (corresponds to frame.f_back).

    Timing data for each function is stored as a 5-tuple in the dictionary
    self.timings[].  The index is always the name stored in self.cur[-3].
    The following are the definitions of the members:

    [0] = The number of times this function was called, not counting direct
          or indirect recursion,
    [1] = Number of times this function appears on the stack, minus one
    [2] = Total time spent internal to this function
    [3] = Cumulative time that this function was present on the stack.  In
          non-recursive functions, this is the total execution time from start
          to finish of each invocation of a function, including time spent in
          all subfunctions.
    [4] = A dictionary indicating for each function name, the number of times
          it was called by us.

    #******************************************************************
    # The following calculates the overhead for using a profiler.  The
    # problem is that it takes a fair amount of time for the profiler
    # to stop the stopwatch (from the time it receives an event).
    # Similarly, there is a delay from the time that the profiler
    # re-starts the stopwatch before the user's code really gets to
    # continue.  The following code tries to measure the difference on
    # a per-event basis.
    #
    # Note that this difference is only significant if there are a lot of
    # events, and relatively little user code per event.  For example,
    # code with small functions will typically benefit from having the
    # profiler calibrated for the current platform.  This *could* be
    # done on the fly during init() time, but it is not worth the
    # effort.  Also note that if too large a value specified, then
    # execution time on some functions will actually appear as a
    # negative number.  It is *normal* for some functions (with very
    # low call counts) to have such negative stats, even if the
    # calibration figure is "correct."
    #
    # One alternative to profile-time calibration adjustments (i.e.,
    # adding in the magic little delta during each event) is to track
    # more carefully the number of events (and cumulatively, the number
    # of events during sub functions) that are seen.  If this were
    # done, then the arithmetic could be done after the fact (i.e., at
    # display time).  Currently, we track only call/return events.
    # These values can be deduced by examining the callees and callers
    # vectors for each functions.  Hence we *can* almost correct the
    # internal time figure at print time (note that we currently don't
    # track exception event processing counts).  Unfortunately, there
    # is currently no similar information for cumulative sub-function
    # time.  It would not be hard to "get all this info" at profiler
    # time.  Specifically, we would have to extend the tuples to keep
    # counts of this in each frame, and then extend the defs of timing
    # tuples to include the significant two figures. I'm a bit fearful
    # that this additional feature will slow the heavily optimized
    # event/time ratio (i.e., the profiler would run slower, fur a very
    # low "value added" feature.)
