# The cycle GC collector can be executed when any GC-tracked object is
# allocated, e.g. during a call to PyList_New(), PyDict_New(), ...
# Moreover, it can invoke arbitrary Python code via a weakref callback.
# This means that there are many places in the source where an arbitrary
# mutation could unexpectedly occur.

# The example below shows list_slice() not expecting the call to
# PyList_New to mutate the input list.  (Of course there are many
# more examples like this one.)
