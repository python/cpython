"""turtledemo/tree.py

Displays a 'breadth-first-tree' - in contrast
to the classical Logo tree drawing programs,
which use a depth-first-algorithm.

Uses:
(1) a tree-generator, where the drawing is
quasi the side-effect, whereas the generator
always yields None.
(2) Turtle-cloning: At each branching point
the current pen is cloned. So in the end
there are 1024 turtles.
