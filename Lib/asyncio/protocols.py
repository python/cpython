    The user should implement this interface.  They can inherit from

    factory to a utility function (e.g., EventLoop.create_connection()).

    When the connection is made successfully, connection_made() is
    called with a suitable transport object.  Then data_received()
    will be called 0 or more times with data (bytes) received from the
    transport; finally, connection_lost() will be called exactly once
