"""Quoted-printable content transfer encoding per RFCs 2045-2047.

This module handles the content transfer encoding method defined in RFC 2045
to encode US ASCII-like 8-bit data called 'quoted-printable'.  It is used to
safely encode text that is in a character set similar to the 7-bit US ASCII
character set, but that includes some 8-bit characters that are normally not
allowed in email bodies or headers.

Quoted-printable is very space-inefficient for encoding binary files; use the
email.base64mime module for that instead.

This module provides an interface to encode and decode both headers and bodies
with quoted-printable encoding.

RFC 2045 defines a method for including character set information in an
'encoded-word' in a header.  This method is commonly used for 8-bit real names
in To:/From:/Cc: etc. fields, as well as Subject: lines.

This module does not do the line wrapping or end-of-line character
conversion necessary for proper internationalized headers; it only
does dumb encoding and decoding.  To deal with the various line
wrapping issues, use the email.header module.
