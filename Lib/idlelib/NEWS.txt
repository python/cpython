What's New in IDLE 3.8.0 (since 3.7.0)
Released on 2019-10-20?
======================================


bpo-37824: Properly handle user input warnings in IDLE shell.
Cease turning SyntaxWarnings into SyntaxErrors.

bpo-37929: IDLE Settings dialog now closes properly when there is no
shell window.

bpo-37849: Fix completions list appearing too high or low when shown
above the current line.

bpo-36419: Refactor autocompete and improve testing.

bpo-37748: Reorder the Run menu.  Put the most common choice,
Run Module, at the top.

bpo-37692: Improve highlight config sample with example shell
interaction and better labels for shell elements.

bpo-37628: Settings dialog no longer expands with font size.
The font and highlight sample boxes gain scrollbars instead.

bpo-17535: Add optional line numbers for IDLE editor windows.

bpo-37627: Initialize the Customize Run dialog with the command line
arguments most recently entered before.  The user can optionally edit
before submitting them.

bpo-33610: Code context always shows the correct context when toggled on.

bpo-36390: Gather Format menu functions into format.py.  Combine
paragraph.py, rstrip.py, and format methods from editor.py.

bpo-37530: Optimize code context to reduce unneeded background activity.
Font and highlight changes now occur along with text changes instead
of after a random delay.

bpo-27452: Cleanup config.py by inlining RemoveFile and simplifying
the handling of __file__ in CreateConfigHandlers/

bpo-26806: To compensate for stack frames added by IDLE and avoid
possible problems with low recursion limits, add 30 to limits in the
user code execution process.  Subtract 30 when reporting recursion
limits to make this addition mostly transparent.

bpo-37325: Fix tab focus traversal order for help source and custom
run dialogs.

bpo-37321: Both subprocess connection error messages now refer to
the 'Startup failure' section of the IDLE doc.

bpo-37177: Properly attach search dialogs to their main window so
that they behave like other dialogs and do not get hidden behind
their main window.

bpo-37039: Adjust "Zoom Height" to individual screens by momentarily
maximizing the window on first use with a particular screen.  Changing
screen settings may invalidate the saved height.  While a window is
maximized, "Zoom Height" has no effect.

bpo-35763: Make calltip reminder about '/' meaning positional-only less
obtrusive by only adding it when there is room on the first line.

bpo-5680: Add 'Run Customized' to the Run menu to run a module with
customized settings. Any command line arguments entered are added
to sys.argv. One can suppress the normal Shell main module restart.

bpo-35610: Replace now redundant editor.context_use_ps1 with
.prompt_last_line.  This finishes change started in bpo-31858.

bpo-32411: Stop sorting dict created with desired line order.

bpo-37038: Make idlelib.run runnable; add test clause.

bpo-36958: Print any argument other than None or int passed to
SystemExit or sys.exit().

bpo-36807: When saving a file, call file.flush() and os.fsync()
so bits are flushed to e.g. a USB drive.

bpo-36429: Fix starting IDLE with pyshell.
Add idlelib.pyshell alias at top; remove pyshell alias at bottom.
Remove obsolete __name__=='__main__' command.

bpo-30348: Increase test coverage of idlelib.autocomplete by 30%.
Patch by Louie Lu.

bpo-23205: Add tests and refactor grep's findfiles.

bpo-36405: Use dict unpacking in idlelib.

bpo-36396: Remove fgBg param of idlelib.config.GetHighlight().
This param was only used twice and changed the return type.

bpo-23216: IDLE: Add docstrings to search modules.

bpo-36176: Fix IDLE autocomplete & calltip popup colors.
Prevent conflicts with Linux dark themes
(and slightly darken calltip background).

bpo-36152: Remove colorizer.ColorDelegator.close_when_done and the
corresponding argument of .close().  In IDLE, both have always been
None or False since 2007.

bpo-36096: Make colorizer state variables instance-only.

bpo-32129: Avoid blurry IDLE application icon on macOS with Tk 8.6.
Patch by Kevin Walzer.

bpo-24310: Document settings dialog font tab sample.

bpo-35689: Add docstrings and tests for colorizer.

bpo-35833: Revise IDLE doc for control codes sent to Shell.
Add a code example block.

bpo-35770: IDLE macosx deletes Options => Configure IDLE.
It previously deleted Window => Zoom Height by mistake.
(Zoom Height is now on the Options menu).  On Mac, the settings
dialog is accessed via Preferences on the IDLE menu.

bpo-35769: Change new file name from 'Untitled' to 'untitled'.

bpo-35660: Fix imports in window module.

bpo-35641: Properly format calltip for function without docstring.

bpo-33987: Use ttk Frame for ttk widgets.

bpo-34055: Fix erroneous 'smart' indents and newlines in IDLE Shell.

bpo-28097: Add Previous/Next History entries to Shell menu.

bpo-35591: Find Selection now works when selection not found.

bpo-35598: Update config_key: use PEP 8 names and ttk widgets,
make some objects global, and add tests.

bpo-35196: Speed up squeezer line counting.

bpo-35208: Squeezer now counts wrapped lines before newlines.

bpo-35555: Gray out Code Context menu entry when it's not applicable.

bpo-22703: Improve the Code Context and Zoom Height menu labels.
The Code Context menu label now toggles between Show/Hide Code Context.
The Zoom Height menu now toggles between Zoom/Restore Height.
Zoom Height has moved from the Window menu to the Options menu.

bpo-35521: Document the editor code context feature.
Add some internal references within the IDLE doc.

bpo-34864: When starting IDLE on MacOS, warn if the system setting
"Prefer tabs when opening documents" is "Always".  As previous
documented for this issue, running IDLE with this setting causes
problems.  If the setting is changed while IDLE is running,
there will be no warning until IDLE is restarted.

bpo-35213: Where appropriate, use 'macOS' in idlelib.

bpo-34864: Document two IDLE on MacOS issues.  The System Preferences
Dock "prefer tabs always" setting disables some IDLE features.
Menus are a bit different than as described for Windows and Linux.

bpo-35202: Remove unused imports in idlelib.

bpo-33000: Document that IDLE's shell has no line limit.
A program that runs indefinitely can overfill memory.

bpo-23220: Explain how IDLE's Shell displays output.
Add new subsection "User output in Shell".

bpo-35099: Improve the doc about IDLE running user code.
"IDLE -- console differences" is renamed "Running user code".
It mostly covers the implications of using custom sys.stdxxx objects.

bpo-35097: Add IDLE doc subsection explaining editor windows.
Topics include opening, title and status bars, .py* extension, and running.

Issue 35093: Document the IDLE document viewer in the IDLE doc.
Add a paragraph in "Help and preferences", "Help sources" subsection.

bpo-1529353: Explain Shell text squeezing in the IDLE doc.

bpo-35088: Update idlelib.help.copy_string docstring.
We now use git and backporting instead of hg and forward merging.

bpo-35087: Update idlelib help files for the current doc build.
The main change is the elimination of chapter-section numbers.

bpo-1529353: Output over N lines (50 by default) is squeezed down to a button.
N can be changed in the PyShell section of the General page of the
Settings dialog.  Fewer, but possibly extra long, lines can be squeezed by
right clicking on the output.  Squeezed output can be expanded in place
by double-clicking the button or into the clipboard or a separate window
by right-clicking the button.

bpo-34548: Use configured color theme for read-only text views.

bpo-33839: Refactor ToolTip and CallTip classes; add documentation
and tests.

bpo-34047: Fix mouse wheel scrolling direction on macOS.

bpo-34275: Make calltips always visible on Mac.
Patch by Kevin Walzer.

bpo-34120: Fix freezing after closing some dialogs on Mac.
This is one of multiple regressions from using newer tcl/tk.

bpo-33975: Avoid small type when running htests.
Since part of the purpose of human-viewed tests is to determine that
widgets look right, it is important that they look the same for
testing as when running IDLE.

bpo-33905: Add test for idlelib.stackview.StackBrowser.

bpo-33924: Change mainmenu.menudefs key 'windows' to 'window'.
Every other menudef key is the lowercase version of the
corresponding main menu entry (in this case, 'Window').

bpo-33906: Rename idlelib.windows as window
Match Window on the main menu and remove last plural module name.
Change imports, test, and attribute references to match new name.

bpo-33917: Fix and document idlelib/idle_test/template.py.
The revised file compiles, runs, and tests OK.  idle_test/README.txt
explains how to use it to create new IDLE test files.

bpo-33904: In rstrip module, rename class RstripExtension as Rstrip.

bpo-33907: For consistency and clarity, rename calltip objects.
Module calltips and its class CallTips are now calltip and Calltip.
In module calltip_w, class CallTip is now CalltipWindow.

bpo-33855: Minimally test all IDLE modules.
Standardize the test file format.  Add missing test files that import
the tested module and perform at least one test.  Check and record the
coverage of each test.

bpo-33856: Add 'help' to Shell's initial welcome message.


What's New in IDLE 3.7.0 (since 3.6.0)
Released on 2018-06-27
======================================

bpo-33656: On Windows, add API call saying that tk scales for DPI.
On Windows 8.1+ or 10, with DPI compatibility properties of the Python
binary unchanged, and a monitor resolution greater than 96 DPI, this
should make text and lines sharper and some colors brighter.
On other systems, it should have no effect.  If you have a custom theme,
you may want to adjust a color or two.  If perchance it make text worse
on your monitor, you can disable the ctypes.OleDLL call near the top of
pyshell.py and report the problem on python-list or idle-dev@python.org.

bpo-33768: Clicking on a context line moves that line to the top
of the editor window.

bpo-33763: Replace the code context label widget with a text widget.

bpo-33664: Scroll IDLE editor text by lines.
(Previously, the mouse wheel and scrollbar slider moved text by a fixed
number of pixels, resulting in partial lines at the top of the editor
box.)  This change also applies to the shell and grep output windows,
but currently not to read-only text views.

bpo-33679: Enable theme-specific color configuration for Code Context.
(Previously, there was one code context foreground and background font
color setting, default or custom, on the extensions tab, that applied
to all themes.)  For built-in themes, the foreground is the same as
normal text and the background is a contrasting gray.  Context colors for
custom themes are set on the Hightlights tab along with other colors.
When one starts IDLE from a console and loads a custom theme without
definitions for 'context', one will see a warning message on the
console.

bpo-33642: Display up to maxlines non-blank lines for Code Context.
If there is no current context, show a single blank line.  (Previously,
the Code Contex had numlines lines, usually with some blank.)  The use
of a new option, 'maxlines' (default 15), avoids possible interference
with user settings of the old option, 'numlines' (default 3).

bpo-33628: Cleanup codecontext.py and its test.

bpo-32831: Add docstrings and tests for codecontext.py.
Coverage is 100%.  Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-33564: Code context now recognizes async as a block opener.

bpo-21474: Update word/identifier definition from ascii to unicode.
In text and entry boxes, this affects selection by double-click,
movement left/right by control-left/right, and deletion left/right
by control-BACKSPACE/DEL.

bpo-33204: Consistently color invalid string prefixes.
A 'u' string prefix cannot be paired with either 'r' or 'f'.
IDLE now consistently colors as much of the prefix, starting at the
right, as is valid.  Revise and extend colorizer test.

bpo-32984: Set __file__ while running a startup file.
Like Python, IDLE optionally runs 1 startup file in the Shell window
before presenting the first interactive input prompt.  For IDLE,
option -s runs a file named in environmental variable IDLESTARTUP or
PYTHONSTARTUP; -r file runs file.  Python sets __file__ to the startup
file name before running the file and unsets it before the first
prompt.  IDLE now does the same when run normally, without the -n
option.

bpo-32940: Replace StringTranslatePseudoMapping with faster code.

bpo-32916: Change 'str' to 'code' in idlelib.pyparse and users.

bpo-32905: Remove unused code in pyparse module.

bpo-32874: IDLE - add pyparse tests with 97% coverage.

bpo-32837: IDLE - require encoding argument for textview.view_file.
Using the system and place-dependent default encoding for open()
is a bad idea for IDLE's system and location-independent files.

bpo-32826: Add "encoding=utf-8" to open() in IDLE's test_help_about.
GUI test test_file_buttons() only looks at initial ascii-only lines,
but failed on systems where open() defaults to 'ascii' because
readline() internally reads and decodes far enough ahead to encounter
a non-ascii character in CREDITS.txt.

bpo-32765: Update configdialog General tab create page docstring.
Add new widgets to the widget list.

bpo-32207: Improve tk event exception tracebacks in IDLE.
When tk event handling is driven by IDLE's run loop, a confusing
and distracting queue.EMPTY traceback context is no longer added
to tk event exception tracebacks.  The traceback is now the same
as when event handling is driven by user code.  Patch based on
a suggestion by Serhiy Storchaka.

bpo-32164: Delete unused file idlelib/tabbedpages.py.
Use of TabbedPageSet in configdialog was replaced by ttk.Notebook.

bpo-32100: Fix old and new bugs in pathbrowser; improve tests.
Patch mostly by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31860: The font sample in the settings dialog is now editable.
Edits persist while IDLE remains open.
Patch by Serhiy Storchake and Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31858: Restrict shell prompt manipulation to the shell.
Editor and output windows only see an empty last prompt line.  This
simplifies the code and fixes a minor bug when newline is inserted.
Sys.ps1, if present, is read on Shell start-up, but is not set or changed.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-28603: Fix a TypeError that caused a shell restart when printing
a traceback that includes an exception that is unhashable.
Patch by Zane Bitter.

bpo-13802: Use non-Latin characters in the Font settings sample.
Even if one selects a font that defines a limited subset of the unicode
Basic Multilingual Plane, tcl/tk will use other fonts that define a
character.  The expanded example give users of non-Latin characters
a better idea of what they might see in the shell and editors.

To make room for the expanded sample, frames on the Font tab are
re-arranged.  The Font/Tabs help explains a bit about the additions.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy

bpo-31460: Simplify the API of IDLE's Module Browser.
Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the
option of creating a browser frame that is only part of a window.
Passing a full file name instead of pieces assumed to come from a
.py file opens the possibility of browsing python files that do not
end in .py.

bpo-31649: Make _htest and _utest parameters keyword-only.
These are used to adjust code for human and unit tests.

bpo-31459: Rename module browser from Class Browser to Module Browser.
The original module-level class and method browser became a module
browser, with the addition of module-level functions, years ago.
Nested classes and functions were added yesterday.  For back-
compatibility, the virtual event <<open-class-browser>>, which
appears on the Keys tab of the Settings dialog, is not changed.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-1612262: Module browser now shows nested classes and functions.
Original patches for code and tests by Guilherme Polo and
Cheryl Sabella, respectively.  Revisions by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31500: Tk's default fonts now are scaled on HiDPI displays.
This affects all dialogs.  Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

bpo-31493: Fix code context update and font update timers.
Canceling timers prevents a warning message when test_idle completes.

bpo-31488: Update non-key options in former extension classes.
When applying configdialog changes, call .reload for each feature class.
Change ParenMatch so updated options affect existing instances attached
to existing editor windows.

bpo-31477: Improve rstrip entry in IDLE doc.
Strip Trailing Whitespace strips more than blank spaces.
Multiline string literals are not skipped.

bpo-31480: fix tests to pass with zzdummy extension disabled. (#3590)
To see the example in action, enable it on options extensions tab.

bpo-31421: Document how IDLE runs tkinter programs.
IDLE calls tcl/tk update in the background in order to make live
interaction and experimentation with tkinter applications much easier.

bpo-31414: Fix tk entry box tests by deleting first.
Adding to an int entry is not the same as deleting and inserting
because int('') will fail.  Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-27099: Convert IDLE's built-in 'extensions' to regular features.
  About 10 IDLE features were implemented as supposedly optional
extensions.  Their different behavior could be confusing or worse for
users and not good for maintenance.  Hence the conversion.
  The main difference for users is that user configurable key bindings
for builtin features are now handled uniformly.  Now, editing a binding
in a keyset only affects its value in the keyset.  All bindings are
defined together in the system-specific default keysets in config-
extensions.def.  All custom keysets are saved as a whole in config-
extension.cfg.  All take effect as soon as one clicks Apply or Ok.
   The affected events are '<<force-open-completions>>',
'<<expand-word>>', '<<force-open-calltip>>', '<<flash-paren>>',
'<<format-paragraph>>', '<<run-module>>', '<<check-module>>', and
'<<zoom-height>>'.  Any (global) customizations made before 3.6.3 will
not affect their keyset-specific customization after 3.6.3. and vice
versa.
  Initial patch by Charles Wohlganger, revised by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31051:  Rearrange condigdialog General tab.
Sort non-Help options into Window (Shell+Editor) and Editor (only).
Leave room for the addition of new options.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30617: Add docstrings and tests for outwin subclass of editor.
Move some data and functions from the class to module level.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31287: Do not modify tkinter.messagebox in test_configdialog.
Instead, mask it with an instance mock that can be deleted.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30781: Use ttk widgets in ConfigDialog pages.
These should especially look better on MacOSX.
Patches by Terry Jan Reedy and Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31206: Factor HighPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bp0-31001: Add tests for configdialog highlight tab.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31205: Factor KeysPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog.
The slightly modified tests continue to pass.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31002: Add tests for configdialog keys tab.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-19903: Change calltipes to use inspect.signature.
Idlelib.calltips.get_argspec now uses inspect.signature instead of
inspect.getfullargspec, like help() does.  This improves the signature
in the call tip in a few different cases, including builtins converted
to provide a signature.  A message is added if the object is not
callable, has an invalid signature, or if it has positional-only
parameters.  Patch by Louie Lu.

bop-31083: Add an outline of a TabPage class in configdialog.
Add template as comment. Update existing classes to match outline.
Initial patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31050: Factor GenPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog.
The slightly modified tests for the General tab continue to pass.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-31004: Factor FontPage(Frame) class from ConfigDialog.
The slightly modified tests continue to pass. The General test
broken by the switch to ttk.Notebook is fixed.
Patch mostly by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-30781: IDLE - Use ttk Notebook in ConfigDialog.
This improves navigation by tabbing.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31060: IDLE - Finish rearranging methods of ConfigDialog.
Grouping methods pertaining to each tab and the buttons will aid
writing tests and improving the tabs and will enable splitting the
groups into classes.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30853: IDLE -- Factor a VarTrace class out of ConfigDialog.
Instance tracers manages pairs consisting of a tk variable and a
callback function.  When tracing is turned on, setting the variable
calls the function.  Test coverage for the new class is 100%.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-31003: IDLE: Add more tests for General tab.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30993: IDLE - Improve configdialog font page and tests.
*In configdialog: Document causal pathways in create_font_tab
docstring.  Simplify some attribute names. Move set_samples calls to
var_changed_font (idea from Cheryl Sabella).  Move related functions to
positions after the create widgets function.
* In test_configdialog: Fix test_font_set so not order dependent.  Fix
renamed test_indent_scale so it tests the widget.  Adjust tests for
movement of set_samples call.  Add tests for load functions.  Put all
font tests in one class and tab indent tests in another.  Except for
two lines, these tests completely cover the related functions.
Patch by Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30981: IDLE -- Add more configdialog font page tests.

bpo-28523: IDLE: replace 'colour' with 'color' in configdialog.

bpo-30917: Add tests for idlelib.config.IdleConf.
Increase coverage from 46% to 96%.
Patch by Louie Lu.

bpo-30913: Document ConfigDialog tk Vars, methods, and widgets in docstrings
This will facilitate improving the dialog and splitting up the class.
Original patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-30899: Add tests for ConfigParser subclasses in config.
Coverage is 100% for those classes and ConfigChanges.
Patch by Louie Lu.

bpo-30881: Add docstrings to browser.py.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-30851: Remove unused tk variables in configdialog.
One is a duplicate, one is set but cannot be altered by users.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-30870: Select font option with Up and Down keys, as well as with mouse.
Added test increases configdialog coverage to 60%
Patches mostly by Louie Lu.

bpo-8231: Call config.IdleConf.GetUserCfgDir only once per process.

bpo-30779: Factor ConfigChanges class from configdialog, put in config; test.
* In config, put dump test code in a function; run it and unittest in
  'if __name__ == '__main__'.
* Add class config.ConfigChanges based on changes_class_v4.py on bpo issue.
* Add class test_config.ChangesTest, partly using configdialog_tests_v1.py.
* Revise configdialog to use ConfigChanges; see tracker msg297804.
* Revise test_configdialog to match configdialog changes.
* Remove configdialog functions unused or moved to ConfigChanges.
Cheryl Sabella contributed parts of the patch.

bpo-30777: Configdialog - add docstrings and improve comments.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-30495: Improve textview with docstrings, PEP8 names, and more tests.
Split TextViewer class into ViewWindow, ViewFrame, and TextFrame classes
so that instances of the latter two can be placed with other widgets
within a multiframe window.
Patches by Cheryl Sabella and Terry Jan Reedy.

bpo-30723: Make several improvements to parenmatch.
* Add 'parens' style to highlight both opener and closer.
* Make 'default' style, which is not default, a synonym for 'opener'.
* Make time-delay work the same with all styles.
* Add help for config dialog extensions tab, including parenmatch.
* Add new tests.
Original patch by Charles Wohlganger.  Revisions by Terry Jan Reedy

bpo-30674: Grep -- Add docstrings.  Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-21519: IDLE's basic custom key entry dialog now detects
duplicates properly. Original patch by Saimadhav Heblikar.

bpo-29910: IDLE no longer deletes a character after commenting out a
region by a key shortcut.  Add "return 'break'" for this and other
potential conflicts between IDLE and default key bindings.
Patch by Serhiy Storchaka.

bpo-30728: Modernize idlelib.configdialog:
* replace import * with specific imports;
* lowercase method and attribute lines.
Patch by Cheryl Sabella.

bpo-6739: Verify user-entered key sequences by trying to bind them
with to a tk widget.  Add tests for all 3 validation functions.
Original patch by G Polo.  Tests added by Cheryl Sabella.
Code revised and more tests added by Terry Jan Reedy
