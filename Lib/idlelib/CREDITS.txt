Guido van Rossum, as well as being the creator of the Python language, is the
original creator of IDLE.  Other contributors prior to Version 0.8 include
Mark Hammond, Jeremy Hylton, Tim Peters, and Moshe Zadka.

Until Python 2.3, IDLE's development was carried out in the SF IDLEfork project. The
objective was to develop a version of IDLE which had an execution environment
which could be initialized prior to each run of user code.
IDLefork was merged into the Python code base in 2003.

The IDLEfork project was initiated by David Scherer, with some help from Peter
Schneider-Kamp and Nicholas Riley.  David wrote the first version of the RPC
code and designed a fast turn-around environment for VPython.  Guido developed
the RPC code and Remote Debugger currently integrated in IDLE.  Bruce Sherwood
contributed considerable time testing and suggesting improvements.

Besides David and Guido, the main developers who were active on IDLEfork
are Stephen M. Gava, who implemented the configuration GUI, the new
configuration system, and the About dialog, and Kurt B. Kaiser, who completed
the integration of the RPC and remote debugger, implemented the threaded
subprocess, and made a number of usability enhancements.

Other contributors include Raymond Hettinger, Tony Lownds (Mac integration),
Neal Norwitz (code check and clean-up), Ronald Oussoren (Mac integration),
Noam Raphael (Code Context, Call Tips, many other patches), and Chui Tey (RPC
integration, debugger integration and persistent breakpoints).

Scott David Daniels, Tal Einat, Hernan Foffani, Christos Georgiou,
Jim Jewett, Martin v. LÃ¶wis, Jason Orendorff, Guilherme Polo, Josh Robb,
Nigel Rowe, Bruce Sherwood, Jeff Shute, and Weeble have submitted useful
