# IDLE reads several config files to determine user preferences.  This
# file is the default config file for general idle settings.
#
# When IDLE starts, it will look in
# the following two sets of files, in order:
#
#     default configuration files in idlelib
#     --------------------------------------
#     config-main.def         default general config file
#     config-extensions.def   default extension config file
#     config-highlight.def    default highlighting config file
#     config-keys.def         default keybinding config file
#
#     user configuration files in ~/.idlerc
#     -------------------------------------
#     config-main.cfg         user general config file
#     config-extensions.cfg   user extension config file
#     config-highlight.cfg    user highlighting config file
#     config-keys.cfg         user keybinding config file
#
# On Windows, the default location of the home directory ('~' above)
# depends on the version.  For Windows 10, it is C:\Users\<username>.
#
# Any options the user saves through the config dialog will be saved to
# the relevant user config file. Reverting any general or extension
# setting to the default causes that entry to be wiped from the user
# file and re-read from the default file.  This rule applies to each
# item, except that the three editor font items are saved as a group.
#
# User highlighting themes and keybinding sets must have (section) names
# distinct from the default names.  All items are added and saved as a
# group. They are retained unless specifically deleted within the config
# dialog. Choosing one of the default themes or keysets just applies the
# relevant settings from the default file.
#
# Additional help sources are listed in the [HelpFiles] section below
# and should be viewable by a web browser (or the Windows Help viewer in
# the case of .chm files). These sources will be listed on the Help
# menu.  The pattern, and two examples, are:
#
# <sequence_number = menu item;/path/to/help/source>
# 1 = IDLE;C:/Programs/Python36/Lib/idlelib/help.html
# 2 = Pillow;https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
#
# You can't use a semi-colon in a menu item or path.  The path will be
# platform specific because of path separators, drive specs etc.
#
# The default files should not be edited except to add new sections to
# config-extensions.def for added extensions.  The user files should be
# modified through the Settings dialog.
