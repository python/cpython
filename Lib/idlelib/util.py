Idlelib objects with no external idlelib dependencies
which are needed in more than one idlelib module.

They are included here because
    a) they don't particularly belong elsewhere; or
    b) because inclusion here simplifies the idlelib dependency graph.

TODO:
    * Python versions (editor and help_about),
    * tk version and patchlevel (pyshell, help_about, maxos?, editor?),
    * std streams (pyshell, run),
    * warning stuff (pyshell, run).
