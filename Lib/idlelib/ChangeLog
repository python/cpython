2001-07-19 16:40  elguavas

	* IDLEFORK.html: replaced by IDLEFORK-index.html

2001-07-19 16:39  elguavas

	* IDLEFORK-index.html: updated placeholder idlefork homepage

2001-07-19 14:49  elguavas

	* ChangeLog, EditorWindow.py, INSTALLATION, NEWS.txt, README.txt,
	TODO.txt, idlever.py:
	minor tidy-ups ready for 0.8.1 alpha tarball release

2001-07-17 15:12  kbk

	* INSTALLATION, setup.py: INSTALLATION: Remove the coexist.patch
	instructions

	**************** setup.py:

	Remove the idles script, add some words on IDLE Fork to the
	long_description, and clean up some line spacing.

2001-07-17 15:01  kbk

	* coexist.patch: Put this in the attic, at least for now...

2001-07-17 14:59  kbk

	* PyShell.py, idle, idles: Implement idle command interface as
	suggested by GvR [idle-dev] 16 July **************** PyShell: Added
	functionality:

	usage: idle.py [-c command] [-d] [-i] [-r script] [-s] [-t title]
	[arg] ...

	idle file(s)	(without options) edit the file(s)

	-c cmd	   run the command in a shell -d	 enable the
	debugger -i	    open an interactive shell -i file(s) open a
	shell and also an editor window for each file -r script  run a file
	as a script in a shell -s	  run $IDLESTARTUP or
	$PYTHONSTARTUP before anything else -t title   set title of shell
	window

	Remaining arguments are applied to the command (-c) or script (-r).

	****************** idles: Removed the idles script, not needed

	****************** idle:  Removed the IdleConf references, not
	required anymore

2001-07-16 17:08  kbk

	* INSTALLATION, coexist.patch: Added installation instructions.

	Added a patch which modifies idlefork so that it can co-exist with
	"official" IDLE in the site-packages directory. This patch is not
	necessary if only idlefork IDLE is installed. See INSTALLATION for
	further details.

2001-07-16 15:50  kbk

	* idles: Add a script "idles" which opens a Python Shell window.

	The default behaviour of idlefork idle is to open an editor window
	instead of a shell. Complex expressions may be run in a fresh
	environment by selecting "run".  There are times, however, when a
	shell is desired.  Though one can be started by "idle -t 'foo'",
	this script is more convenient.  In addition, a shell and an editor
	window can be started in parallel by "idles -e foo.py".

2001-07-16 15:25  kbk

	* PyShell.py: Call out IDLE Fork in startup message.

2001-07-16 14:00  kbk

	* PyShell.py, setup.py: Add a script "idles" which opens a Python
	Shell window.

	The default behaviour of idlefork idle is to open an editor window
	instead of a shell. Complex expressions may be run in a fresh
	environment by selecting "run".  There are times, however, when a
	shell is desired.  Though one can be started by "idle -t 'foo'",
	this script is more convenient.  In addition, a shell and an editor
	window can be started in parallel by "idles -e foo.py".

2001-07-15 03:06  kbk

	* pyclbr.py, tabnanny.py: tabnanny and pyclbr are now found in /Lib

2001-07-15 02:29  kbk

	* BrowserControl.py: Remove, was retained for 1.5.2 support

2001-07-14 15:48  kbk

	* setup.py: Installing Idle to site-packages via Distutils does not
	copy the Idle help.txt file.

	Ref SF Python Patch 422471

2001-07-14 15:26  kbk

	* keydefs.py: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rev 1.3) merge

	"Make copy, cut and paste events case insensitive.  Reported by
	Patrick K. O'Brien on idle-dev. (Should other bindings follow
	suit?)" --GvR

2001-07-14 15:21  kbk

	* idle.py: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rev 1.4) merge

	"Move the action of loading the configuration to the IdleConf
	module rather than the idle.py script.	This has advantages and
	disadvantages; the biggest advantage being that we can more easily
	have an alternative main program."  --GvR

2001-07-14 15:18  kbk

	* extend.txt: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rev 1.4) merge

	"Quick update to the extension mechanism (extend.py is gone, long
	live config.txt)" --GvR

2001-07-14 15:15  kbk

	* StackViewer.py: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rev 1.16) merge

	"Refactored, with some future plans in mind. This now uses the new
	gotofileline() method defined in FileList.py"  --GvR

2001-07-14 15:10  kbk

	* PyShell.py: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rev 1.34) merge

	"Amazing.  A very subtle change in policy in descr-branch actually
	found a bug here.  Here's the deal: Class PyShell derives from
	class OutputWindow.  Method PyShell.close() wants to invoke its
	parent method, but because PyShell long ago was inherited from
	class PyShellEditorWindow, it invokes
	PyShelEditorWindow.close(self).  Now, class PyShellEditorWindow
	itself derives from class OutputWindow, and inherits the close()
	method from there without overriding it.  Under the old rules,
	PyShellEditorWindow.close would return an unbound method restricted
	to the class that defined the implementation of close(), which was
	OutputWindow.close.  Under the new rules, the unbound method is
	restricted to the class whose method was requested, that is
	PyShellEditorWindow, and this was correctly trapped as an error."
	--GvR

2001-07-14 14:59  kbk

	* PyParse.py: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rel 1.9) merge

	"Taught IDLE's autoident parser that "yield" is a keyword that
	begins a stmt.	Along w/ the preceding change to keyword.py, making
	all this work w/ a future-stmt just looks harder and harder."
	--tim_one

	(From Rel 1.8: "Hack to make this still work with Python 1.5.2.
	;-( " --fdrake)

2001-07-14 14:51  kbk

	* IdleConf.py: py-cvs-2001_07_13 (Rel 1.7) merge

	"Move the action of loading the configuration to the IdleConf
	module rather than the idle.py script.	This has advantages and
	disadvantages; the biggest advantage being that we can more easily
	have an alternative main program." --GvR

2001-07-14 14:45  kbk

	* FileList.py: py-cvs-2000_07_13 (Rev 1.9) merge

	"Delete goodname() method, which is unused. Add gotofileline(), a
	convenience method which I intend to use in a variant. Rename
	test() to _test()."  --GvR

	This was an interesting merge. The join completely missed removing
	goodname(), which was adjacent, but outside of, a small conflict.
	I only caught it by comparing the 1.1.3.2/1.1.3.3 diff.  CVS ain't
	infallible.

2001-07-14 13:58  kbk

	* EditorWindow.py: py-cvs-2000_07_13 (Rev 1.38) merge "Remove
	legacy support for the BrowserControl module; the webbrowser module
	has been included since Python 2.0, and that is the preferred
	interface." --fdrake

2001-07-14 13:32  kbk

	* EditorWindow.py, FileList.py, IdleConf.py, PyParse.py,
	PyShell.py, StackViewer.py, extend.txt, idle.py, keydefs.py: Import

	existing 1.1.3 vendor branch named py-cvs-vendor-branch. Release
	tag is py-cvs-2001_07_13.

	* EditorWindow.py: py-cvs-rel2_1 (Rev 1.33 - 1.37) merge

	VP IDLE version depended on VP's ExecBinding.py and spawn.py to get
	the path to the Windows Doc directory (relative to python.exe).
	Removed this conflicting code in favor of py-cvs updates which on
	Windows use a hard coded path relative to the location of this
	module. py-cvs updates include support for webbrowser.py.  Module
	still has BrowserControl.py for 1.5.2 support.

	At this point, the differences wrt py-cvs relate to menu
	functionality.

	* README.txt:
	Updated for pending IDLE 0.5 release (still very rough -- just getting
	it out in a more convenient format than CVS).

	* TODO.txt: Tiny addition.

Thu Sep  9 14:16:02 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TODO.txt: A few new TODO entries.

Thu Aug 26 23:06:22 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Bindings.py: Add Python Documentation entry to Help menu.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Find the help.txt file relative to __file__ or ".", not in sys.path.
	(Suggested by Moshe Zadka, but implemented differently.)

	Add <<python-docs>> event which, on Unix, brings up Netscape pointing
	to http://www.python.doc/current/ (a local copy would be nice but its
	location can't be predicted).  Windows solution TBD.

Wed Aug 11 14:55:43 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TreeWidget.py:
	Moshe noticed an inconsistency in his comment, so I'm rephrasing it to
	be clearer.

	* TreeWidget.py:
	Patch inspired by Moshe Zadka to search for the Icons directory in the
	same directory as __file__, rather than searching for it along sys.path.
	This works better when idle is a package.

Thu Jul 15 13:11:02 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TODO.txt: New wishes.

Sat Jul 10 13:17:35 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* IdlePrefs.py:
	Make the color for stderr red (i.e. the standard warning/danger/stop
	color) rather than green.  Suggested by Sam Schulenburg.

Fri Jun 25 17:26:34 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* PyShell.py: Close debugger when closing.  This may break a cycle.

	* Debugger.py: Break cycle on close.

	* ClassBrowser.py: Destroy the tree when closing.

	* TreeWidget.py: Add destroy() method to recursively destroy a tree.

	* PyShell.py: Extend _close() to break cycles.
	Break some other cycles too (and destroy the root when done).

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Add _close() method that does the actual cleanup (close() asks the
	user what they want first if there's unsaved stuff, and may cancel).
	It closes more than before.

	Add unload_extensions() method to unload all extensions; called from
	_close().  It calls an extension's close() method if it has one.

	* Percolator.py: Add close() method that breaks cycles.

	* WidgetRedirector.py: Add unregister() method.
	Unregister everything at closing.
	Don't call close() in __del__, rely on explicit call to close().

	* IOBinding.py, FormatParagraph.py, CallTips.py:
	Add close() method that breaks a cycle.

Fri Jun 11 15:03:00 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* AutoIndent.py, EditorWindow.py, FormatParagraph.py:
	Tim Peters smart.patch:

	EditorWindow.py:

	+ Added get_tabwidth & set_tabwidth "virtual text" methods, that get/set the
	widget's view of what a tab means.

	+ Moved TK_TABWIDTH_DEFAULT here from AutoIndent.

	+ Renamed Mark's get_selection_index to get_selection_indices (sorry, Mark,
	but the name was plain wrong <wink>).

	FormatParagraph.py:  renamed use of get_selection_index.

	AutoIndent.py:

	+ Moved TK_TABWIDTH_DEFAULT to EditorWindow.

	+ Rewrote set_indentation_params to use new VTW get/set_tabwidth methods.

	+ Changed smart_backspace_event to delete whitespace back to closest
	preceding virtual tab stop or real character (note that this may require
	inserting characters if backspacing over a tab!).

	+ Nuked almost references to the selection tag, in favor of using
	get_selection_indices.  The sole exception is in set_region, for which no
	"set_selection" abstraction has yet been agreed upon.

	+ Had too much fun using the spiffy new features of the format-paragraph
	cmd.

Thu Jun 10 17:48:02 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FormatParagraph.py:
	Code by Mark Hammond to format paragraphs embedded in comments.
	Read the comments (which I reformatted using the new feature :-)
	for some limitations.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Added abstraction get_selection_index() (Mark Hammond).  Also
	reformatted some comment blocks to show off a cool feature I'm about
	to check in next.

	* ClassBrowser.py:
	Adapt to the new pyclbr's support of listing top-level functions.  If
	this functionality is not present (e.g. when used with a vintage
	Python 1.5.2 installation) top-level functions are not listed.

	(Hmm...  Any distribution of IDLE 0.5 should probably include a copy
	of the new pyclbr.py!)

	* AutoIndent.py:
	Fix off-by-one error in Tim's recent change to comment_region(): the
	list of lines returned by get_region() contains an empty line at the
	end representing the start of the next line, and this shouldn't be
	commented out!

	* CallTips.py:
	Mark Hammond writes: Here is another change that allows it to work for
	class creation - tries to locate an __init__ function.  Also updated
	the test code to reflect your new "***" change.

	* CallTipWindow.py:
	Mark Hammond writes: Tim's suggestion of copying the font for the
	CallTipWindow from the text control makes sense, and actually makes
	the control look better IMO.

Wed Jun  9 20:34:57 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* CallTips.py:
	Append "..." if the appropriate flag (for varargs) in co_flags is set.
	Ditto "***" for kwargs.

Tue Jun  8 13:06:07 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ReplaceDialog.py:
	Hmm...  Tim didn't turn "replace all" into a single undo block.
	I think I like it better if it os, so here.

	* ReplaceDialog.py: Tim Peters: made replacement atomic for undo/redo.

	* AutoIndent.py: Tim Peters:

	+ Set usetabs=1.  Editing pyclbr.py was driving me nuts <0.6 wink>.
	usetabs=1 is the Emacs pymode default too, and thanks to indentwidth !=
	tabwidth magical usetabs disabling, new files are still created with tabs
	turned off.  The only implication is that if you open a file whose first
	indent is a single tab, IDLE will now magically use tabs for that file (and
	set indentwidth to 8).  Note that the whole scheme doesn't work right for
	PythonWin, though, since Windows users typically set tabwidth to 4; Mark
	probably has to hide the IDLE algorithm from them (which he already knows).

	+ Changed comment_region_event to stick "##" in front of every line.  The
	"holes" previously left on blank lines were visually confusing (made it
	needlessly hard to figure out what to uncomment later).

Mon Jun  7 15:38:40 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TreeWidget.py, ObjectBrowser.py:
	Remove unnecessary reference to pyclbr from test() code.

	* PyParse.py: Tim Peters:

	Smarter logic for finding a parse synch point.

	Does a half to a fifth the work in normal cases; don't notice the speedup,
	but makes  more breathing room for other extensions.

	Speeds terrible cases by at least a factor of 10. "Terrible" == e.g. you put
	""" at the start of Tkinter.py, undo it, zoom to the bottom, and start
	typing in code.  Used to take about 8 seconds for ENTER to respond, now some
	large fraction of a second.  The new code gets indented correctly, despite
	that it all remains "string colored" until the colorizer catches up (after
	which, ENTER appears instantaneous again).

Fri Jun  4 19:21:19 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* extend.py: Might as well enable CallTips by default.
	If there are too many complaints I'll remove it again or fix it.

Thu Jun  3 14:32:16 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* AutoIndent.py, EditorWindow.py, PyParse.py:
	New offerings by Tim Peters; he writes:

	IDLE is now the first Python editor in the Universe not confused by my
	doctest.py <wink>.

	As threatened, this defines IDLE's is_char_in_string function as a
	method of EditorWindow.  You just need to define one similarly in
	whatever it is you pass as editwin to AutoIndent; looking at the
	EditorWindow.py part of the patch should make this clear.

	* GrepDialog.py: Enclose pattern in quotes in status message.

	* CallTips.py:
	Mark Hammond fixed some comments and improved the way the tip text is
	constructed.

Wed Jun  2 18:18:57 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* CallTips.py:
	My fix to Mark's code: restore the universal check on <KeyRelease>.
	Always cancel on <Key-Escape> or <ButtonPress>.

	* CallTips.py:
	A version that Mark Hammond posted to the newsgroup.  Has some newer
	stuff for getting the tip.  Had to fix the Key-( and Key-) events
	for Unix.  Will have to re-apply my patch for catching KeyRelease and
	ButtonRelease events.

	* CallTipWindow.py, CallTips.py:
	Call tips by Mark Hammond (plus tiny fix by me.)

	* IdleHistory.py:
	Changes by Mark Hammond: (1) support optional output_sep argument to
	the constructor so he can eliminate the sys.ps2 that PythonWin leaves
	in the source; (2) remove duplicate history items.

	* AutoIndent.py:
	Changes by Mark Hammond to allow using IDLE extensions in PythonWin as
	well: make three dialog routines instance variables.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Change by Mark Hammond to allow using IDLE extensions in PythonWin as
	well: make three dialog routines instance variables.

Tue Jun  1 20:06:44 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* AutoIndent.py: Hah!  A fix of my own to Tim's code!
	Unix bindings for <<toggle-tabs>> and <<change-indentwidth>> were
	missing, and somehow that meant the events were never generated,
	even though they were in the menu.  The new Unix bindings are now
	the same as the Windows bindings (M-t and M-u).

	* AutoIndent.py, PyParse.py, PyShell.py: Tim Peters again:

	The new version (attached) is fast enough all the time in every real module
	I have <whew!>.  You can make it slow by, e.g., creating an open list with
	5,000 90-character identifiers (+ trailing comma) each on its own line, then
	adding an item to the end -- but that still consumes less than a second on
	my P5-166.  Response time in real code appears instantaneous.

	Fixed some bugs.

	New feature:  when hitting ENTER and the cursor is beyond the line's leading
	indentation, whitespace is removed on both sides of the cursor; before
	whitespace was removed only on the left; e.g., assuming the cursor is
	between the comma and the space:

	def something(arg1, arg2):
	                   ^ cursor to the left of here, and hit ENTER
	               arg2):   # new line used to end up here
	              arg2):    # but now lines up the way you expect

	New hack:  AutoIndent has grown a context_use_ps1 Boolean config option,
	defaulting to 0 (false) and set to 1 (only) by PyShell.  Reason:  handling
	the fancy stuff requires looking backward for a parsing synch point; ps1
	lines are the only sensible thing to look for in a shell window, but are a
	bad thing to look for in a file window (ps1 lines show up in my module
	docstrings often).  PythonWin's shell should set this true too.

	Persistent problem:  strings containing def/class can still screw things up
	completely.  No improvement.  Simplest workaround is on the user's head, and
	consists of inserting e.g.

	def _(): pass

	(or any other def/class) after the end of the multiline string that's
	screwing them up.  This is especially irksome because IDLE's syntax coloring
	is *not* confused, so when this happens the colors don't match the
	indentation behavior they see.

	* AutoIndent.py: Tim Peters again:

	[Tim, after adding some bracket smarts to AutoIndent.py]
	> ...
	> What it can't possibly do without reparsing large gobs of text is
	> suggest a reasonable indent level after you've *closed* a bracket
	> left open on some previous line.
	> ...

	The attached can, and actually fast enough to use -- most of the time.  The
	code is tricky beyond belief to achieve that, but it works so far; e.g.,

	        return len(string.expandtabs(str[self.stmt_start :
	                                         ^ indents to caret
	                                         i],
	                                     ^ indents to caret
	                                     self.tabwidth)) + 1
	    ^ indents to caret

	It's about as smart as pymode now, wrt both bracket and backslash
	continuation rules.  It does require reparsing large gobs of text, and if it
	happens to find something that looks like a "def" or "class" or sys.ps1
	buried in a multiline string, but didn't suck up enough preceding text to
	see the start of the string, it's completely hosed.  I can't repair that --
	it's just too slow to reparse from the start of the file all the time.

	AutoIndent has grown a new num_context_lines tuple attribute that controls
	how far to look back, and-- like other params --this could/should be made
	user-overridable at startup and per-file on the fly.

	* PyParse.py: New file by Tim Peters:

	One new file in the attached, PyParse.py.  The LineStudier (whatever it was
	called <wink>) class was removed from AutoIndent; PyParse subsumes its
	functionality.

	* AutoIndent.py: Tim Peters keeps revising this module (more to come):

	Removed "New tabwidth" menu binding.

	Added "a tab means how many spaces?" dialog to block tabify and untabify.  I
	think prompting for this is good now:  they're usually at-most-once-per-file
	commands, and IDLE can't let them change tabwidth from the Tk default
	anymore, so IDLE can no longer presume to have any idea what a tab means.

	Irony:  for the purpose of keeping comments aligned via tabs, Tk's
	non-default approach is much nicer than the Emacs/Notepad/Codewright/vi/etc
	approach.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	1. Catch NameError on import (could be raised by case mismatch on Windows).
	2. No longer need to reset pyclbr cache and show watch cursor when calling
	   ClassBrowser -- the ClassBrowser takes care of pyclbr and the TreeWidget
	   takes care of the watch cursor.
	3. Reset the focus to the current window after error message about class
	   browser on buffer without filename.

	* Icons/minusnode.gif, Icons/plusnode.gif: Missed a few.

	* ClassBrowser.py, PathBrowser.py: Rewritten based on TreeWidget.py

	* ObjectBrowser.py: Object browser, based on TreeWidget.py.

	* TreeWidget.py: Tree widget done right.

	* ToolTip.py: As yet unused code for tool tips.

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	Ensure sys.argv[0] is the script name on Run Script.

	* ZoomHeight.py: Move zoom height functionality to separate function.

	* Icons/folder.gif, Icons/openfolder.gif, Icons/python.gif, Icons/tk.gif:
	A few icons used by ../TreeWidget.py and its callers.

	* AutoIndent.py: New version by Tim Peters improves block opening test.

Fri May 21 04:46:17 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Attic/History.py, PyShell.py: Rename History to IdleHistory.
	Add isatty() to pseudo files.

	* StackViewer.py: Make initial stack viewer wider

	* TODO.txt: New wishes

	* AutoIndent.py, EditorWindow.py, PyShell.py:
	Much improved autoindent and handling of tabs,
	by Tim Peters.

Mon May  3 15:49:52 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* AutoIndent.py, EditorWindow.py, FormatParagraph.py, UndoDelegator.py:
	Tim Peters writes:

	I'm still unsure, but couldn't stand the virtual event trickery so tried a
	different sin (adding undo_block_start/stop methods to the Text instance in
	EditorWindow.py).  Like it or not, it's efficient and works <wink>.  Better
	idea?

	Give the attached a whirl.  Even if you hate the implementation, I think
	you'll like the results.  Think I caught all the "block edit" cmds,
	including Format Paragraph, plus subtler ones involving smart indents and
	backspacing.

	* WidgetRedirector.py: Tim Peters writes:

	[W]hile trying to dope out how redirection works, stumbled into two
	possible glitches.  In the first, it doesn't appear to make sense to try to
	rename a command that's already been destroyed; in the second, the name
	"previous" doesn't really bring to mind "ignore the previous value" <wink>.

Fri Apr 30 19:39:25 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* __init__.py: Support for using idle as a package.

	* PathBrowser.py:
	Avoid listing files more than once (e.g. foomodule.so has two hits:
	once for foo + module.so, once for foomodule + .so).

Mon Apr 26 22:20:38 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ChangeLog, ColorDelegator.py, PyShell.py: Tim Peters strikes again:

	Ho ho ho -- that's trickier than it sounded!  The colorizer is working with
	"line.col" strings instead of Text marks, and the absolute coordinates of
	the point of interest can change across the self.update call (voice of
	baffled experience, when two quick backspaces no longer fooled it, but a
	backspace followed by a quick ENTER did <wink>).

	Anyway, the attached appears to do the trick.  CPU usage goes way up when
	typing quickly into a long triple-quoted string, but the latency is fine for
	me (a relatively fast typist on a relatively slow machine).  Most of the
	changes here are left over from reducing the # of vrbl names to help me
	reason about the logic better; I hope the code is a *little* easier to

Fri Apr 23 14:01:25 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Provide full arguments to __import__ so it works in packagized IDLE.

Thu Apr 22 23:20:17 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

        * help.txt:
        Bunch of updates necessary due to recent changes; added docs for File
        menu, command line and color preferences.

        * Bindings.py: Remove obsolete 'script' menu.

	* TODO.txt: Several wishes fulfilled.

	* OutputWindow.py:
	Moved classes OnDemandOutputWindow and PseudoFile here,
	from ScriptBinding.py where they are no longer needed.

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	Mostly rewritten.  Instead of the old Run module and Debug module,
	there are two new commands:

	Import module (F5) imports or reloads the module and also adds its
	name to the __main__ namespace.  This gets executed in the PyShell
	window under control of its debug settings.

	Run script (Control-F5) is similar but executes the contents of the
	file directly in the __main__ namespace.

	* PyShell.py: Nits: document use of $IDLESTARTUP; display idle version

	* idlever.py: New version to celebrate new command line

	* OutputWindow.py: Added flush(), for completeness.

	* PyShell.py:
	A lot of changes to make the command line more useful.  You can now do:
	  idle.py -e file ...    -- to edit files
	  idle.py script arg ... -- to run a script
	  idle.py -c cmd arg ... -- to run a command
	Other options, see also the usage message (also new!) for more details:
	  -d       -- enable debugger
	  -s       -- run $IDLESTARTUP or $PYTHONSTARTUP
	  -t title -- set Python Shell window's title
	sys.argv is set accordingly, unless -e is used.
	sys.path is absolutized, and all relevant paths are inserted into it.

	Other changes:
	- the environment in which commands are executed is now the
	  __main__ module
	- explicitly save sys.stdout etc., don't restore from sys.__stdout__
	- new interpreter methods execsource(), execfile(), stuffsource()
	- a few small nits

	* TODO.txt:
	Some more TODO items.  Made up my mind about command line args,
	Run/Import, __main__.

	* ColorDelegator.py:
	Super-elegant patch by Tim Peters that speeds up colorization
	dramatically (up to 15 times he claims).  Works by reading more than
	one line at a time, up to 100-line chunks (starting with one line and
	then doubling up to the limit).  On a typical machine (e.g. Tim's
	P5-166) this doesn't reduce interactive responsiveness in a noticeable
	way.

Wed Apr 21 15:49:34 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ColorDelegator.py:
	Patch by Tim Peters to speed up colorizing of big multiline strings.

Tue Apr 20 17:32:52 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* extend.txt:
	For an event 'foo-bar', the corresponding method must be called
	foo_bar_event().  Therefore, fix the references to zoom_height() in
	the example.

	* IdlePrefs.py: Restored the original IDLE color scheme.

	* PyShell.py, IdlePrefs.py, ColorDelegator.py, EditorWindow.py:
	Color preferences code by Loren Luke (massaged by me somewhat)

	* SearchEngine.py:
	Patch by Mark Favas: it fixes the search engine behaviour where an
	unsuccessful search wraps around and re-searches that part of the file
	between the start of the search and the end of the file - only really
	an issue for very large files, but... (also removes a redundant
	m.span() call).

Mon Apr 19 16:26:02 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TODO.txt: A few wishes are now fulfilled.

	* AutoIndent.py: Tim Peters implements some of my wishes:

	o Makes the tab key intelligently insert spaces when appropriate
	(see Help list banter twixt David Ascher and me; idea stolen from
	every other editor on earth <wink>).

	o newline_and_indent_event trims trailing whitespace on the old
	line (pymode and Codewright).

	o newline_and_indent_event no longer fooled by trailing whitespace or
	comment after ":" (pymode, PTUI).

	o newline_and_indent_event now reduces the new line's indentation after
	return, break, continue, raise and pass stmts (pymode).

	The last two are easy to fool in the presence of strings &
	continuations, but pymode requires Emacs's high-powered C parsing
	functions to avoid that in finite time.

======================================================================
	Python release 1.5.2c1, IDLE version 0.4
======================================================================

Wed Apr  7 18:41:59 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* README.txt, NEWS.txt: New version.

	* idlever.py: Version bump awaiting impending new release.
	(Not much has changed :-( )

Mon Mar 29 14:52:28 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ScriptBinding.py, PyShell.py:
	At Tim Peters' recommendation, add a dummy flush() method to
	PseudoFile.

Thu Mar 11 23:21:23 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* PathBrowser.py: Don't crash when sys.path contains an empty string.

	* Attic/Outline.py: This file was never supposed to be part of IDLE.

	* PathBrowser.py:
	- Don't crash in the case where a superclass is a string instead of a
	pyclbr.Class object; this can happen when the superclass is
	unrecognizable (to pyclbr), e.g. when module renaming is used.

	- Show a watch cursor when calling pyclbr (since it may take a while
	recursively parsing imported modules!).

Wed Mar 10 05:18:02 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* EditorWindow.py, Bindings.py: Add PathBrowser to File module

	* PathBrowser.py: "Path browser" - 4 scrolled lists displaying:
	    directories on sys.path
	    modules in selected directory
	    classes in selected module
	    methods of selected class

	Single clicking in a directory, module or class item updates the next
	column with info about the selected item.  Double clicking in a
	module, class or method item opens the file (and selects the clicked
	item if it is a class or method).

	I guess eventually I should be using a tree widget for this, but the
	ones I've seen don't work well enough, so for now I use the old
	Smalltalk or NeXT style multi-column hierarchical browser.

	* MultiScrolledLists.py:
	New utility: multiple scrolled lists in parallel

	* ScrolledList.py: - White background.
	- Display "(None)" (or text of your choosing) when empty.
	- Don't set the focus.

Wed Feb 17 22:47:41 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* NEWS.txt: News in 0.3.

	* README.txt, idlever.py: Bump version to 0.3.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	After all, we don't need to call the callbacks ourselves!

	* WindowList.py:
	When deleting, call the callbacks *after* deleting the window from our list!

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Fix up the Windows menu via the new callback mechanism instead of
	depending on menu post commands (which don't work when the menu is
	torn off).

	* WindowList.py:
	Support callbacks to patch up Windows menus everywhere.

	* ChangeLog: Oh, why not.  Checking in the Emacs-generated change log.

Tue Feb 16 22:34:17 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	Only pop up the stack viewer when requested in the Debug menu.

Mon Feb  8 22:27:49 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* WindowList.py: Don't crash if a window no longer exists.

	* TODO.txt: Restructured a bit.

Mon Feb  1 23:06:17 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* PyShell.py: Add current dir or paths of file args to sys.path.

	* Debugger.py: Add canonic() function -- for brand new bdb.py feature.

	* StackViewer.py: Protect against accessing an empty stack.

Fri Jan 29 20:44:45 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ZoomHeight.py:
	Use only the height to decide whether to zoom in or out.

Thu Jan 28 22:24:30 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* EditorWindow.py, FileList.py:
	Make sure the Tcl variables are shared between windows.

	* PyShell.py, EditorWindow.py, Bindings.py:
	Move menu/key binding code from Bindings.py to EditorWindow.py,
	with changed APIs -- it makes much more sense there.
	Also add a new feature: if the first character of a menu label is
	a '!', it gets a checkbox.  Checkboxes are bound to Boolean Tcl variables
	that can be accessed through the new getvar/setvar/getrawvar API;
	the variable is named after the event to which the menu is bound.

	* Debugger.py: Add Quit button to the debugger window.

	* SearchDialog.py:
	When find_again() finds exactly the current selection, it's a failure.

	* idle.py, Attic/idle: Rename idle -> idle.py

Mon Jan 18 15:18:57 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* EditorWindow.py, WindowList.py: Only deiconify when iconic.

	* TODO.txt: Misc

Tue Jan 12 22:14:34 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* testcode.py, Attic/test.py:
	Renamed test.py to testcode.py so one can import Python's
	test package from inside IDLE.  (Suggested by Jack Jansen.)

	* EditorWindow.py, ColorDelegator.py:
	Hack to close a window that is colorizing.

	* Separator.py: Vladimir Marangozov's patch:
	The separator dances too much and seems to jump by arbitrary amounts
	in arbitrary directions when I try to move it for resizing the frames.
	This patch makes it more quiet.

Mon Jan 11 14:52:40 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* TODO.txt: Some requests have been fulfilled.

	* EditorWindow.py:
	Set the cursor to a watch when opening the class browser (which may
	take quite a while, browsing multiple files).

	Newer, better center() -- but assumes no wrapping.

	* SearchBinding.py:
	Got rid of debug print statement in goto_line_event().

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	I think I like it better if it prints the traceback even when it displays
	the stack viewer.

	* Debugger.py: Bind ESC to close-window.

	* ClassBrowser.py: Use a HSeparator between the classes and the items.
	Make the list of classes wider by default (40 chars).
	Bind ESC to close-window.

	* Separator.py:
	Separator classes (draggable divider between two panes).

Sat Jan  9 22:01:33 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* WindowList.py:
	Don't traceback when wakeup() is called when the window has been destroyed.
	This can happen when a torn-of Windows menu references closed windows.
	And Tim Peters claims that the Windows menu is his favorite to tear off...

	* EditorWindow.py: Allow tearing off of the Windows menu.

	* StackViewer.py: Close on ESC.

	* help.txt: Updated a bunch of things (it was mostly still 0.1!)

	* extend.py: Added ScriptBinding to standard bindings.

	* ScriptBinding.py:
	This now actually works.  See doc string.  It can run a module (i.e.
	import or reload) or debug it (same with debugger control).  Output
	goes to a fresh output window, only created when needed.

======================================================================
	Python release 1.5.2b1, IDLE version 0.2
======================================================================

Fri Jan  8 17:26:02 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* README.txt, NEWS.txt: What's new in this release.

	Paul Prescod's patches to allow the stack viewer to pop up when a
	traceback is printed.

Thu Jan  7 00:12:15 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FormatParagraph.py:
	Change paragraph width limit to 70 (like Emacs M-Q).

	* README.txt:
	Separating TODO from README.  Slight reformulation of features.  No
	exact release date.

	* TODO.txt: Separating TODO from README.

Mon Jan  4 21:19:09 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FormatParagraph.py:
	Hm.  There was a boundary condition error at the end of the file too.

	* SearchBinding.py: Hm.  Add Unix binding for replace, too.

	* keydefs.py: Ran eventparse.py again.

	* FormatParagraph.py: Added Unix Meta-q key binding;
	fix find_paragraph when at start of file.

	* AutoExpand.py: Added Meta-/ binding for Unix as alt for Alt-/.

	* SearchBinding.py:
	Add unix binding for grep (otherwise the menu entry doesn't work!)

	* ZoomHeight.py: Adjusted Unix height to work with fvwm96. :=(

	* GrepDialog.py: Need to import sys!

	* help.txt, extend.txt, README.txt: Formatted some paragraphs

	* extend.py, FormatParagraph.py:
	Add new extension to reformat a (text) paragraph.

	* ZoomHeight.py: Typo in Win specific height setting.

Sun Jan  3 00:47:35 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* AutoIndent.py: Added something like Tim Peters' backspace patch.

	* ZoomHeight.py: Adapted to Unix (i.e., more hardcoded constants).

Sat Jan  2 21:28:54 1999  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* keydefs.py, idlever.py, idle.pyw, idle.bat, help.txt, extend.txt, extend.py, eventparse.py, ZoomHeight.py, WindowList.py, UndoDelegator.py, StackViewer.py, SearchEngine.py, SearchDialogBase.py, SearchDialog.py, ScrolledList.py, SearchBinding.py, ScriptBinding.py, ReplaceDialog.py, Attic/README, README.txt, PyShell.py, Attic/PopupMenu.py, OutputWindow.py, IOBinding.py, Attic/HelpWindow.py, History.py, GrepDialog.py, FileList.py, FrameViewer.py, EditorWindow.py, Debugger.py, Delegator.py, ColorDelegator.py, Bindings.py, ClassBrowser.py, AutoExpand.py, AutoIndent.py:
	Checking in IDLE 0.2.

	Much has changed -- too much, in fact, to write down.
	The big news is that there's a standard way to write IDLE extensions;
	see extend.txt.  Some sample extensions have been provided, and
	some existing code has been converted to extensions.  Probably the
	biggest new user feature is a new search dialog with more options,
	search and replace, and even search in files (grep).

	This is exactly as downloaded from my laptop after returning
	from the holidays -- it hasn't even been tested on Unix yet.

Fri Dec 18 15:52:54 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* FileList.py, ClassBrowser.py:
	Fix the class browser to work even when the file is not on sys.path.

Tue Dec  8 20:39:36 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Attic/turtle.py: Moved to Python 1.5.2/Lib

	* EditorWindow.py, FileList.py: Support underlining of menu labels

	* Bindings.py:
	New approach, separate tables for menus (platform-independent) and key
	definitions (platform-specific), and generating accelerator strings
	automatically from the key definitions.

Mon Nov 16 18:37:42 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Attic/README: Clarify portability and main program.

Sat Oct 24 16:38:38 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Attic/turtle.py: Raise the root window on reset().
	Different action on WM_DELETE_WINDOW is more likely to do the right thing,
	allowing us to destroy old windows.

	* Attic/turtle.py:
	Split the goto() function in two: _goto() is the internal one,
	using Canvas coordinates, and goto() uses turtle coordinates
	and accepts variable argument lists.

	* Attic/turtle.py: Cope with destruction of the window

	* Attic/turtle.py: Turtle graphics

	* Debugger.py: Use of Breakpoint class should be bdb.Breakpoint.

Mon Oct 19 03:33:40 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	Change our special entries from <console#N> to <pyshell#N>.
	Patch linecache.checkcache() to keep our special entries alive.
	Add popup menu to all editor windows to set a breakpoint.

	Use and pass through the 'force' flag to set_dict() where appropriate.
	Default source and globals checkboxes to false.
	Don't interact in user_return().
	Add primitive set_breakpoint() method.

	* ColorDelegator.py:
	Raise priority of 'sel' tag so its foreground (on Windows) will take
	priority over text colorization (which on Windows is almost the
	same color as the selection background).

	Define a tag and color for breakpoints ("BREAK").

	* Attic/PopupMenu.py: Disable "Open stack viewer" and "help" commands.

	* StackViewer.py:
	Add optional 'force' argument (default 0) to load_dict().
	If set, redo the display even if it's the same dict.

Fri Oct 16 21:10:12 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* StackViewer.py: Do nothing when loading the same dict as before.

	* PyShell.py: Details for debugger interface.

	* Debugger.py:
	Restructured and more consistent.  Save checkboxes across instantiations.

	Get rid of conflicting ^X binding.  Use ^W.

	* Debugger.py, StackViewer.py:
	Debugger can now show local and global variables.

	* Debugger.py: Oops

	* Debugger.py, PyShell.py: Better debugger support (show stack etc).

Thu Oct 15 23:27:08 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* ClassBrowser.py, ScrolledList.py:
	Generalized the scrolled list which is the base for the class and
	method browser into a separate class in its own module.

	* Attic/test.py: Cosmetic change

	* Debugger.py: Don't show function name if there is none

Wed Oct 14 03:43:05 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Debugger.py, PyShell.py: Polish the Debugger GUI a bit.
	Closing it now also does the right thing.

Tue Oct 13 23:51:13 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* Debugger.py, PyShell.py, Bindings.py:
	Ad primitive debugger interface (so far it will step and show you the

	* ClassBrowser.py:
	Adding the beginnings of a Class browser.  Incomplete, yet.

	* EditorWindow.py, Bindings.py:
	Add new command, "Open module".  You select or type a module name,
	and it opens the source.

Mon Oct 12 23:59:27 1998  Guido van Rossum  <guido@cnri.reston.va.us>

	* PyShell.py: Subsume functionality from Popup menu in Debug menu.
	Other stuff so the PyShell window can be resurrected from the Windows menu.

	* FileList.py: Get rid of PopUp menu.
	Create a simple Windows menu.  (Imperfect when Untitled windows exist.)
