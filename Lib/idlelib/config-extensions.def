# IDLE reads several config files to determine user preferences.  This
# file is the default configuration file for IDLE extensions settings.
#
# Each extension must have at least one section, named after the
# extension module. This section must contain an 'enable' item (=True to
# enable the extension, =False to disable it), it may contain
# 'enable_editor' or 'enable_shell' items, to apply it only to editor ir
# shell windows, and may also contain any other general configuration
# items for the extension.  Other True/False values will also be
# recognized as boolean by the Extension Configuration dialog.
#
# Each extension must define at least one section named
# ExtensionName_bindings or ExtensionName_cfgBindings. If present,
# ExtensionName_bindings defines virtual event bindings for the
# extension that are not user re-configurable. If present,
# ExtensionName_cfgBindings defines virtual event bindings for the
# extension that may be sensibly re-configured.
#
# If there are no keybindings for a menus' virtual events, include lines
# like <<toggle-code-context>>=.
#
# Currently it is necessary to manually modify this file to change
# extension key bindings and default values. To customize, create
# ~/.idlerc/config-extensions.cfg and append the appropriate customized
# section(s).  Those sections will override the defaults in this file.
#
# Note: If a keybinding is already in use when the extension is loaded,
# the extension's virtual event's keybinding will be set to ''.
#
# See config-keys.def for notes on specifying keys and extend.txt for
# information on creating IDLE extensions.

# A fake extension for testing and example purposes.  When enabled and
# invoked, inserts or deletes z-text at beginning of every line.
