** TIPS **
==========

Additional Help Sources:

	Windows users can Google on zopeshelf.chm to access Zope help files in
	the Windows help format.  The Additional Help Sources feature of the
	configuration GUI supports .chm, along with any other filetypes
	supported by your browser.  Supply a Menu Item title, and enter the
	location in the Help File Path slot of the New Help Source dialog.  Use
	http:// and/or www. to identify external URLs, or download the file and
	browse for its path on your machine using the Browse button.

	All users can access the extensive sources of help, including
	tutorials, available at www.python.org/doc.  Selected URLs can be added
	or removed from the Help menu at any time using Configure IDLE.

Basic editing and navigation:

	Backspace deletes to the left; DEL deletes to the right.
	Arrow keys and Page Up/Down move around.
	Control-left/right Arrow moves by words in a strange but useful way.
	Home/End go to begin/end of line.
	Control-Home/End go to begin/end of file.
	Some useful Emacs bindings (Control-a, Control-e, Control-k, etc.)
		are inherited from Tcl/Tk.
	Standard Windows bindings may work on that platform.
	Keybindings are selected in the Settings Dialog, look there.

Automatic indentation:

	After a block-opening statement, the next line is indented by 4 spaces
	(in the Python Shell window by one tab).  After certain keywords
	(break, return etc.) the next line is dedented.  In leading
	indentation, Backspace deletes up to 4 spaces if they are there.  Tab
	inserts spaces (in the Python Shell window one tab), number depends on
	Indent Width.  (N.B. Currently tabs are restricted to four spaces due
	to Tcl/Tk issues.)

        See also the indent/dedent region commands in the edit menu.

Python Shell window:

	Control-c interrupts executing command.
	Control-d sends end-of-file; closes window if typed at >>> prompt
		(this is Control-z on Windows).

    Command history:

	Alt-p retrieves previous command matching what you have typed.
	Alt-n retrieves next.
	      (These are Control-p, Control-n on the Mac)      
	Return while cursor is on a previous command retrieves that command.
	Expand word is also useful to reduce typing.

    Syntax colors:

	The coloring is applied in a background "thread", so you may
	occasionally see uncolorized text.  To change the color
	scheme, use the Configure IDLE / Highlighting dialog.

    Python default syntax colors:

	Keywords	orange
	Builtins	royal purple
	Strings		green
	Comments	red
	Definitions	blue

    Shell default colors:

	Console output	brown
	stdout		blue
	stderr		red
	stdin		black

Other preferences:

	The font preferences, keybinding, and startup preferences can
	be changed using the Settings dialog.

Command line usage:
	
	Enter idle -h at the command prompt to get a usage message.

Running without a subprocess:

	If IDLE is started with the -n command line switch it will run in a
	single process and will not create the subprocess which runs the RPC
	Python execution server.  This can be useful if Python cannot create
	the subprocess or the RPC socket interface on your platform.  However,
	in this mode user code is not isolated from IDLE itself.  Also, the
	environment is not restarted when Run/Run Module (F5) is selected.  If
	your code has been modified, you must reload() the affected modules and
	re-import any specific items (e.g. from foo import baz) if the changes
	are to take effect.  For these reasons, it is preferable to run IDLE
	with the default subprocess if at all possible.
