** TIPS **
==========

Additional Help Sources:

	Windows users can Google on pythlp.chm and zopeshelf.chm to access help
	files in the Windows help format.  The Additional Help Sources feature
	of the configuration GUI supports .chm, along with any other filetypes
	supported by your browser.  Supply a Menu Item title, and enter the
	location in the Help File Path slot of the New Help Source dialog.  Use
	http:// and/or www. to identify external URLs, or download the file and
	browse for its path on your machine using the Browse button.

	All users can access the extensive sources of help, including
	tutorials, available at www.python.org/doc.  Selected URLs can be added
	or removed from the Help menu at any time.

Basic editing and navigation:

	Backspace deletes to the left; DEL deletes to the right
	Arrow keys and Page Up/Down to move around
	Home/End go to begin/end of line
	Control-Home/End go to begin/end of file
	Some Emacs or standard Windows bindings may work.
	Keybindings are selected in the Settings Dialog, look there.

Automatic indentation:

	After a block-opening statement, the next line is indented by
	4 spaces (in the Python Shell window by one tab).  After
	certain keywords (break, return etc.) the next line is
	dedented.  In leading indentation, Backspace deletes up to 4
	spaces if they are there.  Tab inserts spaces (in the
	Python Shell window one tab), number depends on Indent Width
        See also the indent/dedent region commands in the edit menu.

Python Shell window:

	^C interrupts executing command
	^D sends end-of-file; closes window if typed at >>> prompt

    Command history:

	Alt-p retrieves previous command matching what you have typed
	Alt-n retrieves next
	Return while on any previous command retrieves that command
	Alt-/ (Expand word) is also useful here

Syntax colors:

	The coloring is applied in a background "thread", so you may
	occasionally see uncolorized text.  To change the color
	scheme, use the Settings/Highlighting dialog.

    Python default syntax colors:

	Keywords	orange
	Strings		green
	Comments	red
	Definitions	blue

    Shell default colors:

	Console output	brown
	stdout		blue
	stderr		dark green
	stdin		black

Other preferences:

	The font preferences, keybinding, and startup preferences can
	be changed using the Settings dialog.

Command line usage:
	
	Enter idle -h at the command prompt to get a usage message.
