"""__future__:  Record of phased-in incompatible language changes.

Each line is of the form:

    FeatureName = ReleaseInfo

ReleaseInfo is a pair of the form:

    (OptionalRelease, MandatoryRelease)

where, normally, OptionalRelease < MandatoryRelease, and both are 5-tuples
of the same form as sys.version_info:

    (PY_MAJOR_VERSION, # the 2 in 2.1.0a3; an int
     PY_MINOR_VERSION, # the 1; an int
     PY_MICRO_VERSION, # the 0; an int
     PY_RELEASE_LEVEL, # "alpha", "beta", "candidate" or "final"; string
     PY_RELEASE_SERIAL # the 3; an int
    )

OptionalRelease records the first release in which

    from __future__ import FeatureName

was accepted.

In the case of MandatoryReleases that have not yet occurred,
MandatoryRelease predicts the release in which the feature will become part
of the language.

Else MandatoryRelease records when the feature became part of the language;
in releases at or after that, modules no longer need

    from __future__ import FeatureName

to use the feature in question, but may continue to use such imports.

MandatoryRelease may also be None, meaning that a planned feature got
dropped.

No line is ever to be deleted from this file.
