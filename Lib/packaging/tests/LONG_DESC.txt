CLVault
=======

CLVault uses Keyring to provide a command-line utility to safely store
and retrieve passwords.

Install it using pip or the setup.py script::

    $ python setup.py install

    $ pip install clvault

Once it's installed, you will have three scripts installed in your
Python scripts folder, you can use to list, store and retrieve passwords::

    $ clvault-set blog
    Set your password:
    Set the associated username (can be blank): tarek
    Set a description (can be blank): My blog password
    Password set.

    $ clvault-get blog
    The username is "tarek"
    The password has been copied in your clipboard

    $ clvault-list
    Registered services:
    blog    My blog password


*clvault-set* takes a service name then prompt you for a password, and some
optional information about your service. The password is safely stored in
a keyring while the description is saved in a ``.clvault`` file in your
home directory. This file is created automatically the first time the command
is used.

*clvault-get* copies the password for a given service in your clipboard, and
displays the associated user if any.

*clvault-list* lists all registered services, with their description when
given.
