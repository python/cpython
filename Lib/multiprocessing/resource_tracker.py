# Server process to keep track of unlinked resources (like shared memory
# segments, semaphores etc.) and clean them.
#
# On Unix we run a server process which keeps track of unlinked
# resources. The server ignores SIGINT and SIGTERM and reads from a
# pipe.  Every other process of the program has a copy of the writable
# end of the pipe, so we get EOF when all other processes have exited.
# Then the server process unlinks any remaining resource names.
#
# This is important because there may be system limits for such resources: for
# instance, the system only supports a limited number of named semaphores, and
# shared-memory segments live in the RAM. If a python process leaks such a
# resource, this resource will not be removed till the next reboot.  Without
# this resource tracker process, "killall python" would probably leave unlinked
# resources.
