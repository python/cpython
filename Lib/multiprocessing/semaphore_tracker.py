#
# On Unix we run a server process which keeps track of unlinked
# semaphores. The server ignores SIGINT and SIGTERM and reads from a
# pipe.  Every other process of the program has a copy of the writable
# end of the pipe, so we get EOF when all other processes have exited.
# Then the server process unlinks any remaining semaphore names.
#
# This is important because the system only supports a limited number
# of named semaphores, and they will not be automatically removed till
# the next reboot.  Without this semaphore tracker process, "killall
# python" would probably leave unlinked semaphores.
